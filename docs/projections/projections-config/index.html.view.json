This means that write amplification is a possibility, as each event that the projection emits writes a separate event.

This option sets the number of concurrent writes that a projection can perform.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"projections/projections-config.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"74\" sourceendlinenumber=\"74\">By default, projections try to perform writes as quickly as they come.
