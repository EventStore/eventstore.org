This class maintains a set of large segments and gives clients pieces of these segments that they can use for their buffers. The alternative to this would be to create many small arrays which it then maintained. This methodology should be slightly better than the many small array methodology because in creating only a few very large objects it will force these objects to be placed on the LOH.

    "keywords": "Deploy with Kubernetes to Azure Cloud AKS This guide is to show how to use the official Event Store Helm Chart to interactively deploy an Event Store Cluster in Kubernetes Azure Cloud AKS service. Prerequisites Install the following utilities in your development machine. Kubectl Helm The Azure CLI Configuration steps Login in your Azure Cloud account using the az cli, this triggers 2 factor authentication that launches your default browser to select account credentials. az login Create a new resource group: az group create -n {resourcegroupname} -l {location-compatible-with-aks} Create a Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes. This command accept parameters such as the version of Kubernetes you want installed. For this tutorial we use the default options. az aks create -n {clustername} -g {resourcegroupname} -c 3 The command (after some delay) returns a JSON object with details of the new Kubernetes cluster. Use the command below to return a list of all Kubernetes clusters in your Azure account: az aks list -o table We recommend kubectl for managing resources in the Kubernetes cluster. Set the current context for kubectl and merge it with any existing configuration in your existing config file: az aks get-credentials -n {clustername} -g {groupname} Get the list of nodes using kubectl: kubectl get nodes To use the Kubernetes dashboard you need to change the Role Base Access Control enabled by default on Azure AKS. Create a rbac-config.yaml file containing the following yaml: apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: kubernetes-dashboard labels: k8s-app: kubernetes-dashboard roleRef: apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind: ClusterRole name: cluster-admin subjects: - kind: ServiceAccount name: kubernetes-dashboard namespace: kube-system Create a deployment for this ClusterRoleBinding object kubectl create -f ./rbac-config.yaml To access the dashboard you can now use the browse command. This command is a wrapper around the proxy command of kubectl. It creates a local web server with a tunnel to the cluster hosted in Azure AKS web server az aks browse -n {clustername} -g {groupname} Deploy Event Store Cluster with Helm Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. After you've created a new Kubernetes cluster you need to configure Helm for your local helm CLI to connect to a configured service account on the server side. The service account used by Helm is called Tiller. Give Tiller access to the cluster and initialise it with the following commands: kubectl -n kube-system create serviceaccount tiller kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller helm init --service-account tiller You can then check if the tiller-deploy-xxxx pod is running kubectl -n kube-system get pod Now deploy the Event Store cluster using the official Helm Chart with the following commands: helm repo add eventstore https://eventstore.github.io/EventStore.Charts helm repo update helm install -n eventstore eventstore/eventstore --set persistence.enabled=true The Event Store cluster is now deployed and available in a couple of minutes. The default cluster size in the Helm Chart is set to 3 so this results in a 3 node Event Store cluster over the 3 nodes Kubernetes cluster. The setting persistence.enable=true uses a PersistentVolumeClaim on your Kubernetes cluster to claim dynamically persistent storage volumes. You can configure this to use statically defined volumes if required. Upgrade the Event Store cluster with a newer version Verify your current Event Store cluster helm status eventstore Fork the official Helm Chart Event Store repository and change the version of the image in the chart values.yaml . Then run the command in the same directory as the chart: helm upgrade eventstore . --set persistence.enabled=true The upgrade command silently upgrades all the pods one by one without downtime. Helm takes care of attaching the existing volumes to the new pods during the upgrade. Rollback to a previous version To rollback to a previous version, first use the following command to display the history helm history eventstore And the following command to rollback to a specific revision helm rollback eventstore 1 Delete resources To delete all resources associated with the EventStore installation use the following command: az aks delete -n {clustername} -g {groupname} az group delete -n {groupname}"

Event Stream 'streamname' Each individual stream shows pages of the events in a stream with an overview of the event. Click the Name to see the EventId, and JSON to the see the event data. The buttons above change depending on what you are viewing in the interface. The Back button takes you to the parent screen. The buttons on the top right when you are viewing an event stream are: Pause : Stop showing events arriving into this stream. Resume : Resume showing events arriving into this stream. Edit ACL : Edit the access control lists for a stream. Add Event : Add a new event to the stream. Delete : Delete a stream to the stream. Query : The buttons on the left above the events when you are viewing an event stream are: self : Takes you to the overview of the stream. first : Takes you to the first page of events in a stream. previous : Takes you to the previous page of events in a stream. metadata : Shows the metadata of a stream. On the metadata screen, click Add New Like This to add a new event to the stream. Projections The Projections tab shows system and user created projections defined in Event Store, the buttons above the list do the following: Disable All : Disable all running projections. Enable All : Enable all stopped projections. Include Queries : New Projection : Create a user-defined projection with the Admin UI. Clicking an individual projection shows further details.

It uses the following system event types: PersistentConfig : An event that records a configuration event, the event data contains: version : Version of event data updated : Updated date updatedBy : User who updated configuration maxCount : The number of configuration events to save entries : Configuration items set by event. Find more details of configuration items for the .NET API and the HTTP API . $all $all is a special paged stream for all events. You can use the same paged form of reading described above to read all events for a node by pointing the stream at /streams/$all . As it's a stream like any other, you can perform all operations, except posting to it. $settings The $settings stream has a special ACL used as the default ACL. This stream controls the default ACL for streams without an ACL and also controls who can create streams in the system, the default state of these is shown below: { \"$userStreamAcl\": { \"$r\": \"$all\", \"$w\": \"$all\", \"$d\": \"$all\", \"$mr\": \"$all\", \"$mw\": \"$all\" }, \"$systemStreamAcl\": { \"$r\": \"$admins\", \"$w\": \"$admins\", \"$d\": \"$admins\", \"$mr\": \"$admins\", \"$mw\": \"$admins\" } } The $userStreamAcl controls the default ACL for user streams, while all system streams use the $systemStreamAcl as the default. Note The $w in $userStreamAcl also applies to the ability to create a stream. Members of $admins always have access to everything, you cannot remove this permission. When you set a permission on a stream, it overrides the default values. However, it's not necessary to specify all permissions on a stream. It's only necessary to specify those which differ from the default. $stats Event Store has debug and statistics information available about a cluster in the $stats stream, find out more in the stats guide . $scavenges $scavenges is a special paged stream for all scavenge related events.

    "title": "Users and Access Control Lists | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Users and Access Control Lists Default Users Event Store provides two default users, $ops and $admin . $admin has full access to everything in Event Store. It can read and write to protected streams, which is any stream that starts with $, such as $projections-master . Protected streams are usually system streams, for example, $projections-master manages some of the projections' states. The $admin user can also run operational commands, such as scavenges and shutdowns on Event Store. $ops can run operational commands like the $admin user, but cannot read protected streams. New Users New users created in Event Store are standard users. They can't read protected streams or perform operations. If you add a user into the $ops or $admins group, they have the same level of access as those users. By default, any user can read any non-protected stream unless there is an ACL preventing that. Stream ACLs Event Store keeps the ACL of a stream in the streams metadata as JSON with the below definition: { \"$acl\": { \"$w\": \"$admins\", \"$r\": \"$all\", \"$d\": \"$admins\", \"$mw\": \"$admins\", \"$mr\": \"$admins\" } } These fields represent the following: $w The permission to write to this stream. $r The permission to read from this stream. $d The permission to delete this stream. $mw The permission to write the metadata associated with this stream. $mr The permission to read the metadata associated with this stream. You can update these fields with either a single string or an array of strings representing users or groups ( $admins , $all , or custom groups). It's possible to put an empty array into one of these fields, and this has the effect of removing all users from that permission. Note We recommend you don't give people access to $mw as then they can then change the ACL. Example The ACL below would give writer read and write permission on the stream, while reader would have read permission on the stream. Only users in the $admins group would be able to delete the stream or read and write the metadata.

For more information on how to properly configure varnish for your requirements, read the Varnish documentation . Ben Clark's Gist contains a varnish configuration that includes basic authentication as well as some other niceties such as adding headers for hits/misses. Install Varnish sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install varnish Configure Varnish Open /etc/default/varnish and edit the section that looks like the below to the port with the port you want to run on: DAEMON_OPTS=\"-a :80 \\ -T localhost:6082 \\ -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl \\ -S /etc/varnish/secret \\ -s malloc,256m\" Open /etc/varnish/default.vcl and edit the backend section to match Event Store: backend default { .host = \"127.0.0.1\"; .port = \"2114\"; } Finally use sudo service varnish restart to restart varnish and Event Store should be running with a reverse proxy in front of it. If you want to check the status of varnish, use varnishstat ."

    "title": "Scavenging events | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Scavenging events When you delete events or streams in Event Store, they aren't removed immediately. To permanently delete these events you need to run a 'scavenge' on your database. A scavenge reclaims disk space by rewriting your database chunks, minus the events to delete, and then deleting the old chunks. Scavenges only affect completed chunks, so deleted events in the current chunk are still there after you run a scavenge. After processing the chunks, the operation updates the chunk indexes using a merge sort algorithm, skipping events whose data is no longer available. Warning Once a scavenge has run, you cannot recover any deleted events. Note Before version 4.0.2, a scavenge operation only worked with database chunk files. Since version 4.0.2 that reordering also happens inside the index files. Starting a scavenge Scavenges are not run automatically by Event Store. We recommendation that you set up a scheduled task, for example using cron or Windows Scheduler, to trigger a scavenge as often as you need. You start a scavenge by issuing an empty POST request to the HTTP API with the credentials of an admin or ops user: Request Response curl -i -d {} -X POST http://localhost:2113/admin/scavenge -u \"admin:changeit\" Next Steps Scavenge operations have other options you can set to improve performance, read the API docs for more details.

If you need to restart a stopped scavenge, you can specify the starting chunk ID. Find out more in the API reference . You can also start scavenges from the Admin page of the Admin UI. Tip Each node in a cluster has its own independent database. As such, when you run a scavenge, you need to issue a scavenge request to each node. How often to run a scavenge This depends on the following: How often you delete streams. Depending on how you set $maxAge , $maxCount or $tb metadata on your streams. Stopping a scavenge Stop a running scavenge operation by issuing a DELETE request to the HTTP API with the credentials of an admin or ops user and the ID of the scavenge you want to stop: curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:2113/admin/scavenge/{scavengeId} -u \"admin:changeit\" You can also stop scavenges from the Admin page of the Admin UI. Tip Each node in a cluster has its own independent database. As such, when you run a scavenge, you need to issue a scavenge request to each node. How often should you run a scavenge This depends on the following: How often you delete streams. How you set $maxAge , $maxCount or $tb metadata on your streams. Tip Read the .NET API or HTTP API docs for more details on setting metadata. Scavenging while Event Store is online It's safe to run a scavenge while Event Store is running and processing events, as it's designed to be an online operation. Warning Scavenging increases the number of reads/writes made to disk, and it is not recommended when your system is under heavy load."

    "href": "server/node-roles/index.html",
    "title": "Cluster Node Roles | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Cluster Node Roles Every node in an Event Store cluster can have one of three roles. Master A cluster assigns the Master role based on an election process. The node with the Master role ensures that the data are committed and persisted to disk before sending back to the client an acknowledge message. A cluster can only have one Master at a time. If a cluster detects two nodes with a Master role, a new election begins and shuts down the node with less data to restart and re-join the cluster. Slave A cluster assigns the Slave role based on an election process. A cluster uses one or more nodes with the Slave role to form the quorum, or the majority of nodes necessary to confirm that a write is persisted. Clone If you add nodes to a cluster beyond the number of nodes specified in the ClusterSize setting the cluster automatically assigns them the Clone role. A cluster asynchronously replicates data one way to a node with the Clone role. You don't need to wait for an acknowledgement message as the node is not part of the quorum. For this reason a node with a Clone role does not add much overhead to the other nodes. If a cluster loses nodes to take it below ClusterSize , then the cluster can promote a Clone to a Master or Slave role. You can control which clones the cluster promotes with the NodePriority command line option . The default value is 0 , and the cluster is more likely to promote clones with higher values. Note Changing NodePriority doesn't guarantee that the cluster won't promote the clone. It's only one of the criteria that the Election Service considers. Non Promotable Clone If you want the cluster to never promote a node with the Clone role, set the --is-promotable command line option to false when starting a clone node. The node never acknowledges any writes and is never part of the quorum until you change the option to true . Non promotable clones are best used for data redundancy, or for locally hosted nodes you use for application testing."

    "title": "Deleting streams and events | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Deleting streams and events Meta data in Event Store defines whether an event is deleted or not. You can use stream metadata such as TruncateBefore , MaxAge and MaxCount to filter events considered deleted. When reading a stream, the index checks the stream's metadata to determine whether any of its events have been deleted. $all bypasses the index, meaning that it does not check the metadata to determine whether events exist or not. As such, events that have been deleted are still be readable until a scavenge has removed them. There are requirements for a scavenge to successfully remove events, for more information about this, read the scavenging guide . Warning The last event in a stream is always kept as a record of the last event number in the stream. Soft delete and TruncateBefore TruncateBefore and $tb considers any event with an event number equal to or lower than its value as deleted. For example, if you had the following events in a stream : 0@test-stream 1@test-stream 2@test-stream 3@test-stream If you set the TruncateBefore or $tb value to 2, a read of the stream would result in only reading the last event: 3@test-stream A Soft delete makes use of TruncateBefore and $tb . When you delete a stream, its TruncateBefore or $tb is set to the streams current last event number. When you read a soft deleted stream, the read returns a StreamNotFound or 404 result. After deleting the stream, you are able to write to it again, continuing from where it left off. For example, if you soft deleted the above example stream, the TruncateBefore or $tb is set to 3 (the stream's current event number). If you were to write to the stream again, the next event is written with event number 4. Only events from event number 4 onwards are visible when you read this stream. Max count and Max age Max count ( $maxCount and MaxCount ) limits the number of events that you can read from a stream. If you try to read a stream that has a max count of 5, you are only able to read the last 5 events, regardless of how many events are in the stream. Max age ( $maxAge and MaxAge ) specifies the number of seconds an event can live for. The age is calculated at the time of the read. So if you read a stream with a MaxAge of 3 minutes and one of the events in the stream has existed for 4 minutes at the time of the read, it is not returned. Hard delete A hard delete writes a tombstone event to the stream, permanently deleting it. You cannot recreate the stream, or write to it again. Tombstone events are written with the event type $streamDeleted . When you read a hard deleted stream, the read returns a StreamDeleted or 410 result. The events in the deleted stream are liable to be removed in a scavenge, but the tombstone event remains. Warning A hard delete of a stream is permanent. You cannot write to the stream or recreate it. As such, you should generally soft delete streams unless you have a specific need to permanently delete the stream. Deleted events and projections If you are intending on using projections and deleting streams, there are some things to take into consideration: Due to the nature of $all , projections using fromAll read any deleted events that have not been scavenged. They also receive any tombstone events from hard deletes. Projections that read from a specific stream receive that stream's metadata events. You can filter these out by ignoring events with an event type $metadata ."

Backing up a database Copy all *.chk files to your backup location. Copy the remaining files and directories to your backup location. For example: rsync -a /data/eventstore/db/*.chk /backup/eventstore/db/ rsync -a /data/eventstore/db/index /backup/eventstore/db/ rsync -a /data/eventstore/db/*.0* /backup/eventstore/db/ Restoring a database Create a copy of chaser.chk and call it truncate.chk . Copy all files to the desired location. Note Many people do not rely on hot backups in a highly available cluster but instead increase their node counts to keep further copies of data. Differential backup Event Store keep most data in chunk files , named chunkX.Y , where X is the chunk number, and Y is the version of that chunk file. As Event Store scavenges, it creates new versions of scavenged chunks which are interchangeable with older versions (but for the removed data). It's only necessary to keep the file whose name has the highest Y for each X , as well as the checkpoint files and the index directory (to avoid expensive index rebuilding). Other Options There are many other options available for backing up an Event Store database. For example, you can set up a durable subscription that writes all events to another storage mechanism such as a key/value or column store. These methods would require a manual set up for restoring back to a cluster group. You can expand upon this option to use a second Event Store node/cluster as a back up. This is commonly known as a primary/secondary back up scheme. The primary cluster runs and asynchronously pushes data to a second cluster as described above. The second cluster/node is available in case of disaster on the primary cluster. If you are using this strategy then we recommend you only support manual failover from Primary to Secondary as automated strategies risk causing a split brain problem."

    "keywords": "Setting up a Cluster using only Database Nodes (OSS) <!-- TODO: Needs Linux instructions --> High availability Event Store allows you to run more than one node as a cluster. There are two modes available for clustering: With database nodes only (open source and commercial) With manager nodes and database nodes (commercial only) This document covers setting up Event Store with only database nodes. Tip When setting up a cluster, you generally want an odd number of nodes as Event Store uses a quorum based algorithm to handle high availability. We recommended you define an odd number of nodes to avoid split brain problems. Common values for the ‘ClusterSize’ setting are 3 or 5 (to have a majority of 2 nodes and a majority of 3 nodes). Next Steps Read here for more information on the roles available for nodes in an Event Store cluster. Running on the Same Machine To start, set up three nodes running on a single machine. Run each of the commands below in its own console window. You either need admin privileges or have ACLs setup with IIS if running under Windows. Unix-like operating systems need no configuration. Replace \"127.0.0.1\" with whatever IP address you want to run on. EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log .\\logs\\log1 --int-ip 127.0.0.1 --ext-ip 127.0.0.1 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=1113 --ext-http-port=1114 --cluster-size=3 --discover-via-dns=false --gossip-seed=127.0.0.1:2113,127.0.0.1:3113 EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log .\\logs\\log2 --int-ip 127.0.0.1 --ext-ip 127.0.0.1 --int-tcp-port=2111 --ext-tcp-port=2112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --discover-via-dns=false --gossip-seed=127.0.0.1:1113,127.0.0.1:3113 EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log .\\logs\\log3 --int-ip 127.0.0.1 --ext-ip 127.0.0.1 --int-tcp-port=3111 --ext-tcp-port=3112 --int-http-port=3113 --ext-http-port=3114 --cluster-size=3 --discover-via-dns=false --gossip-seed=127.0.0.1:1113,127.0.0.1:2113 You should now have three nodes running together in a cluster. If you kill one of the nodes, it continues running. This binds to the loopback interface. To access Event Store from outside your machine, specify a different IP address for the --ext-ip parameter. Running on Separate Machines Most important is to understand the \"gossip seeds\". You are instructing seed locations for when the node first starts and needs to begin gossiping. Any node can be a seed. By giving each node the other nodes you ensure that there is always another node to gossip with if a quorum can be built. If you wanted to move this to run on three machines you would change the IPs on the command line to something such as: EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log c:\\dbs\\cluster\\log1 --int-ip 192.168.0.1 --ext-ip 192.168.0.1 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --discover-via-dns=false --gossip-seed=192.168.0.2:2113,192.168.0.3:2113 EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log c:\\dbs\\cluster\\log2 --int-ip 192.168.0.2 --ext-ip 192.168.0.2 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --discover-via-dns=false --gossip-seed=192.168.0.1:2113,192.168.0.3:2113 EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log c:\\dbs\\cluster\\log3 --int-ip 192.168.0.3 --ext-ip 192.168.0.3 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --discover-via-dns=false --gossip-seed=192.168.0.1:2113,192.168.0.2:2113 Using DNS Entering the commands above into each node is tedious and error-prone (especially as the replica set counts change). Another configuration option is to create a DNS entry that points to all the nodes in the cluster and then specify that DNS entry with the appropriate port: EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --log c:\\dbs\\cluster\\log1 --int-ip 192.168.0.1 --ext-ip 192.168.0.1 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --cluster-dns mydomain.com --cluster-gossip-port=2113 EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log c:\\dbs\\cluster\\log2 --int-ip 192.168.0.2 --ext-ip 192.168.0.2 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --cluster-dns mydomain.com --cluster-gossip-port=2113 EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --mem-db --log c:\\dbs\\cluster\\log3 --int-ip 192.168.0.3 --ext-ip 192.168.0.3 --int-tcp-port=1111 --ext-tcp-port=1112 --int-http-port=2113 --ext-http-port=2114 --cluster-size=3 --cluster-dns mydomain.com --cluster-gossip-port=2113 Note You can also use the method above for HTTP clients to avoid using a load balancer and fall back to round robin DNS for many deployments. Internal vs. External Networks You can optionally segregate all Event Store communications to different networks. For example, internal networks for tasks like replication, and external networks for communication between clients. You can place these communications on segregated networks which is often a good idea for both performance and security purposes. To setup an internal network, use the command line parameters provided above, but prefixed with int- . All communications channels also support enabling SSL for the connections. HTTP Clients If you want to use the HTTP API, then you should add a load balancer in front of the three nodes. It does not matter which node receives a request as the requests the node are forwarded to the request internally. With this setup, you can lose any one machine with no data loss. Native TCP Clients You can connect to the cluster using the native TCP interface. The client APIs support switching between nodes internally. As such if you have a master failover the connection automatically handle retries on another node. To set up a connection as above, provide gossip seeds to the connection. The client then uses the gossip seeds to begin gossiping information about the cluster. EventStoreConnection.Create( ConnectionSettings.Create().KeepReconnecting(), ClusterSettings.Create() .WithGossipTimeoutOf(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)) .WithGossipSeeds(new [] { new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"192.168.0.1\"), 2113), new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"192.168.0.2\"), 2113), new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Parse(\"192.168.0.3\"), 2113) })); As in the example above, you can also use DNS to avoid manually specifying the seeds. You add the nodes to a DNS record and then specify that DNS entry to the connection to locate nodes. EventStoreConnection.Create(ConnectionSettings.Create() .KeepReconnecting(), ClusterSettings.Create() .SetClusterDns(\"mycluster.com\")) .SetGossipPort(2113) The connection automatically reconnects during node failures. You can control this behaviour with options on the ConnectionSettings such as limiting retry attempts or frequency. The connection and durable subscription even manage a subscription during node failures, you will not receive duplicated messages over your durable subscription. Tip For those using the closed source version of Event Store GossipPort is an alias for ManagerPort as the closed source version includes a node manager on each physical node. This allows for controlling many virtual nodes on a machine with easy configuration. The manager also acts as a supervisor for the nodes."

    "keywords": "Setting up a Cluster with Manager Nodes <!-- TODO: How much of this is also relevant to OSS? --> High availability Event Store allows you to run more than one node as a cluster. There are two modes available for clustering: With database nodes only (open source and commercial) With manager nodes and database nodes (commercial only) This document covers setting up Event Store with manager nodes and database nodes. Tip When setting up a cluster, you generally want an odd number of nodes as Event Store uses a quorum based algorithm to handle high availability. We recommended you define an odd number of nodes to avoid split brain problems. Common values for the ‘ClusterSize’ setting are 3 or 5 (to have a majority of 2 nodes and a majority of 3 nodes). Next Steps Read here for more information on the roles available for nodes in an Event Store cluster. Manager Nodes Each physical (or virtual) machine in an Event Store cluster typically runs one manager node and one database node. It's also possible to have multiple database nodes per physical machine, running under one manager node. Manager nodes have a number of responsibilities: They are responsible for starting the database nodes and supervising them to ensure they rest in case of a crash or termination owing to abnormal circumstances. Event Store calls this the watchdog service. They communicate with other manager nodes to find cluster state, and relay that information to the database nodes under management. They provide a known endpoint for clients to connect to and discover cluster information. When running on Windows, manager nodes run as Windows services. Configuring Nodes Each database or manager node can have a variety of configuration sources . Each source has a priority and determines running configuration by evaluating each source and applying the option from the source with the highest priority. From lowest to highest priority, the sources of configuration are: Default settings. Settings specified in a configuration file written using YAML. Settings specified in environment variables. Settings specified as command line options to the node. You can check the configuration of a node by passing the -WhatIf flag to the process. Typical Deployment Topologies Event Store clusters follow a \"shared nothing\" philosophy, meaning that clustering requires no shared disks for clustering to work. Instead, several database nodes store your data to ensure it isn't lost in case of a drive failure or a node crashing. Event Store uses a quorum-based replication model, in which a majority of nodes in the cluster must acknowledge that they committed a write to disk before acknowledging the write to the client. This means that to be able to tolerate the failure of n nodes, the cluster must be of size (2n + 1) . A three-database-node cluster can continue to accept writes if one node is unavailable. A five-database-node cluster can continue to accept writes if two nodes are unavailable, and so forth. A typical deployment topology consists of three physical machines, each running one manager node and one database node. Each of the physical machines may have two network interfaces, one for communicating with other cluster members, and one for serving clients. Although it may be preferable in some situations to run over two separate networks. It's also possible to use different TCP ports on one interface. Cluster gossip Event Store uses a quorum-based replication model. When working normally, a cluster has one database node known as a master , and the remaining nodes are slaves . The master node is responsible for coordinating writes while it is the master. Database nodes use a consensus algorithm to determine which database node should be master and which should be slaves. Event Store bases the decision as to which node should be the master on a number of factors ( some of which are configurable ). For database nodes to have this information available to them, the nodes gossip with other nodes in the cluster. Gossip runs over the internal (and optionally the external) HTTP interfaces of database nodes, and over both internal and external interfaces of manager nodes. Discovering cluster members Manager and database nodes need to know about one another to gossip. To start this process, you provide gossip seeds or the addresses where it can find other nodes, to each node. When running with manager nodes, it normally uses the following approach: On each physical machine, configure the database node(s) with a gossip seed of the internal HTTP interface of the manager running on the same physical machine. Configure the managers to discover other managers in one of two ways: via a DNS entry and a well-known gossip port. via a list of other managers' addresses. The preferred method is via a DNS entry. To set this up, create a DNS entry for the cluster with an A record pointing to each member of the cluster. Each manager looks up other nodes in the cluster during the startup process based on the DNS name. Since DNS only provides information about addresses, you need to use a consistent TCP port across the cluster for gossip. <!-- TODO: Should this be more practical? --> Example 1 - A Three-Machine Cluster This example shows the configuration for a three node cluster, running in the typical setup of one manager node and one database node per physical machine, with cluster discovery via DNS. Each machine has one network interface, therefore uses different ports for the internal and external traffic. All nodes, in this case, are running Windows, so the manager nodes run as Windows services. The important points for writing configuration files are: Node IP Addresses: 192.168.1.11, 192.168.1.12 and 192.168.13 TCP ports: (defaults): Manager Nodes: Internal HTTP: 30777 External HTTP: 30778 Database Nodes: Internal TCP: 1112 External TCP: 1113 Internal HTTP: 2112 External HTTP: 2113 DNS Entry Name: cluster1.eventstore.local To configure the cluster correctly, there are a number of steps to follow: Set up a DNS entry named cluster1.eventstore.local with an A record for each node. Write the database node configuration file for each machine. Write the manager node configuration file for each machine. Write the watchdog configuration file for each machine. Deploy Event Store and the configuration files to each machine. ( Windows-specific ) Add HTTP URL ACL entries to allow starting HTTP servers on the required HTTP ports. ( Windows-specific ) Install the manager as a service and start the service. ( Linux-specific ) Configure the manager as a daemon. DNS entry It depends on which DNS server you use, but the eventual lookup should read: $ nslookup cluster1.eventstore.local Server: 192.168.1.2 Address: 192.168.1.2#53 Name: cluster.eventstore.local Address: 192.168.1.11 Name: cluster.eventstore.local Address: 192.168.1.12 Name: cluster.eventstore.local Address: 192.168.1.13 Database Node Configuration All three nodes are similar in configuration. The important configuration points are the: IP Addresses for internal and external interfaces. The ports for each endpoint. The location of the database file. The size of the cluster The endpoints from which to seed gossip (in this case the local manager). We assume that Event Store stores data on the _D:_ drive. You write the configuration files in YAML, and is the following for the first node: Filename: database.yaml Db: d:\\es-data IntIp: 192.168.1.11 ExtIp: 192.168.1.11 IntTcpPort: 1112 IntHttpPort: 2112 ExtTcpPort: 1113 ExtHttpPort: 2113 DiscoverViaDns: false GossipSeed: ['192.168.1.11:30777'] ClusterSize: 3 For each following node, the IP Addresses change, as does the gossip seed, since it is the manager running on the same physical machine as each node. Manager Configuration Again, all three nodes are similar in configuration. The important configuration points are the: IP addresses for the internal and external interfaces. The ports for the HTTP endpoints. The log location. The DNS information about other nodes. Another important configuration item is which database nodes the manager is responsible for starting. You define this in a separate file (the watchdog configuration), the path to which you specify as WatchdogConfig in the manager configuration. You write the configuration files in YAML, and is the following for the first node: Filename: manager.yaml IntIp: 192.168.1.11 ExtIp: 192.168.1.11 IntHttpPort: 30777 ExtHttpPort: 30778 DiscoverViaDns: true ClusterDns: cluster1.eventstore.local ClusterGossipPort: 30777 EnableWatchdog: true WatchdogConfig: c:\\EventStore-Config\\watchdog.esconfig Log: d:\\manager-log Watchdog Configuration The watchdog configuration file details which database nodes the manager is responsible for starting and supervising. Unlike the other configuration files, the manager configuration uses a custom format instead of YAML. Each node for which the manager is responsible has one line in the file, which starts with a # symbol and then details the command line options given to the database node when it starts it. Under normal circumstances, this is the path to the database node's configuration file. For the first node in the example cluster, the watchdog configuration file reads as follows: # --config c:\\EventStore-Config\\database.yaml Deploying Event Store software and configuration With configuration files for each node written, you can now deploy Event Store and the configuration. Although it's possible to use relative paths when writing configuration files, it's preferable to use absolute paths to reduce the potential for confusion. In this example, Event Store is deployed on each node in _c:\\EventStore-HA-v_, and the configuration files for that node are deployed into _C:\\EventStore-Config_. No installation process is necessary, you unzip the packaged distribution into your preferred location. Adding HTTP ACL entries for HTTP servers (Windows-Specific) <!-- TODO: Check this --> To allow for non-elevated users to run HTTP servers on Windows, you must add entries to the access control list using netsh . By default, the manager node runs as NT AUTHORITY\\Local Service , so this is the user who must have permission to run the HTTP server. The commands used to add these entries on node one are as follows (Run as an elevated user): # Database Node Internal HTTP Interface netsh http add urlacl url=http://192.168.1.11:2112/ user=\"NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE\" # Database Node External HTTP Interface netsh http add urlacl url=http://192.168.1.11:2113/ user=\"NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE\" # Manager Node Internal HTTP Interface netsh http add urlacl url=http://192.168.1.11:30777/ user=\"NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE\" # Manager Node External HTTP Interface netsh http add urlacl url=http://192.168.1.11:30778/ user=\"NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE\" Configure the Manager Node as a service (Windows-Specific) You can install manager nodes as a Windows service so they can start on boot rather than running in interactive mode. Each manager service is given an instance name, which becomes the name of the service (and part of the description for easy identification). The service is installed by default with a startup type of \"Automatic (Delayed Start)\". Installing the service To install the manager node on machine 1, use the following command: C:\\EventStore-HA-v\\> EventStore.WindowsManager.exe install -InstanceName es-cluster1 -ManagerConfig C:\\EventStore-Config\\manager.yaml The service is then visible in the services list, with a description of \"Event Store Manager (es-cluster1)\". Uninstalling the service To uninstall the manager node service, use the following command (where the instance name matches the name used during installation). C:\\EventStore-HA-v\\> EventStore.WindowsManager.exe uninstall -InstanceName es-cluster1 Manually starting and stopping the service To start the manager node use the net start es-cluster1 command. To stop the manager node use the net stop es-cluster1 command."

Event Store treats data transactionally with full durability assurances, but this doesn't help you if the hardware on your machine does not support it. Many consumer grade disks (and SSDs especially) lie about durability to appear faster. This is fine until you have a power outage and lose information. These issues do not just affect Event Store. Other vendors and projects have created tests to check whether you may be losing data. We recommend running one of these such tests against your production environment. You can check the state of your drives on Linux by using the following command: sudo hdparm -I {drive} For example, check /dev/sda to see if caching is enabled on your drive. Be wary though, just because caching is disabled does not mean that all writes are fully durable. If you are running Linux you might want to consider adding the following to /etc/hdparm.conf : /dev/yourdrive { write_cache = off } If you are running the clustered version of Event Store you may wish to allow these unlikely events to happen. The drives run faster with caching enabled and it's unlikely that you would lose three machines at the same time with corruption. If this were to happen you can truncate your data and re-replicate from the other nodes."

    "title": "Internal Architectural Overview | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Internal Architectural Overview <!-- TODO: Overview image or intro? --> Messaging The architecture style of Event Store is SEDA (Staged Event Driven Architecture) . Messages flow forward through queues internally, including the Transaction File which is also a queue. There are communication endpoints that flow forward through series of queues to be processed. All operations are purely asynchronous. The core processing runs on a single thread reading requests off of a single concurrent queue. Messages first flow through a state machine that represents the state of the node. In a distributed scenario a node is not always allowed to write (slaves forward writes, not write themselves), or if the node is still initializing its not allowed to read. Each request is handled by a state machine that manages the lifecycle of that request including time outs and acknowledgements throughout the cluster. Because of this architecture, the main monitoring points of Event Store is the status of the queues. You can view the status in the health area of the admin interface or through the HTTP API. It's also periodically written to a special $statistics-node:port stream. <!-- TODO: Which endpoint --> <!-- TODO: IMAGE(s)--> The most common queue to be slow is the storage writer as it writes to storage in a durable fashion. It uses fsync and flushfile buffers to ensure that data is persisted to disk and survives, say a power outage on the machine. The storage writer is capable of writing more than 15,000 transactions to disk per second on the open source single node version. Transaction File Event Store provides durable storage including handling cases where the power may be turned off to a machine through the use of a commit log. The commit log is a conceptual constantly appending file (though it is not implemented this way <!-- TODO: This is confusing, link to more details? --> ). Every write to Event Store appends to this file. The commit log is built not as one large file but as a series of small files implemented with an abstraction called a 'TFChunk'. For all files it writes, Event Store always writes sequentially, except for checkpoints, although there is a non-performing sequential version of checkpoints. This results in seeks not being necessary for writes. While less of a problem with SSDs, this can drastically help with performance of spindle drives. It also allows for the possibility to store data for Event Store (both indexes and the transaction file) on write once media. Entire TFChunks are cached by loading the entire chunk into unmanaged memory. Most of the memory usage by Event Store is unmanaged. It's rare to see it use more than a few hundred megabytes in managed heaps. Even in these scenarios most of the memory is in the large object heap (LOH) and point to native types such as byte[] to put a minimum load possible on the garbage collector. Scavenging The chunks in the transaction file are periodically scavenged to remove deleted or old data, and depending on stream rules such as $maxCount in the stream metadata, can be compacted. This process generates new chunks and switches them out atomically, deleting them once they are no longer in use by readers. This gives the benefit that, once completed, TFChunks are immutable. This includes the current chunk. Since it's only written to sequentially it never seeks back to overwrite something. Every record in the log has an ID. The ID is the logical position at which the record was originally written to disk. This is useful as an identifier, as in a scenario where you are not deleting you know exactly where the record is stored. When you begin scavenging this location can move. As part of the process of scavenging a TFChunk, a map is written of remappings from the original IDs. This is crucial because index points back to these IDs. This map allows the index and the TFChunks to be scavenged independently. If, during the scavenge process, the overhead of the map outweighs the benefit of the scavenge the scavenge is not performed. Chunks that are completed also have an MD5 checksum to validate the data inside of them since disks do occasionally go bad or mangle data. This checksum is checked periodically to validate that the data is not corrupted. Index Event Store only has one index. You should use projections for building application level indexes. The index is immutable. Queries executed against Event Store are always to get an event represented as a sequence number inside of a stream. The index is optimized for this purpose. Each record in the index is 16 bytes: 4 bytes for the hash of the stream ID. 4 bytes for the sequence number. 8 bytes for the original position the record had in the log. This identifier of a record is useful as you can avoid additional lookups when writing the record to disk, this can change due to scavenging of the transaction file. As transactions are written to the transaction file, where an in-memory index is appended. A query hits the in memory index. The in-memory index is implemented as a hash of sorted lists with a fine grained lock on the stream. When there are enough items in the in-memory index, the index is flushed to disk (known as a 'PTable' or 'Persistent Table'). A PTable is a sorted group of index entries (remember that they are only 16 bytes each). A binary search across the PTables is used to search. The search function has been memoized by storing midpoints in memory. Mid point caching reduces the number of seeks from log(n) by the depth to which midpoints are filled and often all are in memory. Index Rebuilds You can copy indexes from machine to machine providing the data structure is the same. This guide explains how the index rebuild process works when you add new nodes to a cluster, or backup and restore an index. TFiles make up a transaction log, but conceptually they are one continuous file. Event Store breaks them up into many files instead of one big file for operational reasons such as incremental back ups. This mechanism also tends to play better with the filesystem. Rebuilding an index requires starting from position 0 in this large continuous file and then moving forward indexing every item one at a time. Rebuilds on a New Node When Event Store starts on a blank machine there are no persistent indexes, there is only a memtable (in memory index). There is a limit to how many items the memory index can store (1 million). When an index hits this number, the index is then moved to a disk based format known as a PTable. Event Store stores what the position was in the TFile for what the PTable represents. In a single index file example it may be 0,12345678 meaning the index covers all transactions between position 0 and 12345678s . When Event Store loads the index, it calculates the position that the persistent index covers, in this example, 12345678 . After loading the index, Event Store then knows that the index covers all events before positions 12345678 , and does not need to take them into account. Event Store then rebuilds the memory index from position 12345678 up to the current, which you can see in log output when Event Store starts. PTables get merged into larger PTables over time. During this operation they are scavenged for items to be removed. The merging of N PTables to 1 larger PTable is a linear operation as they are all sorted. Once written to disk, PTables are immutable and have like TFchunks MD5 checksums. Unlike a failure in a TFChunk checksum, if a problem is found within the index it's simply rebuilt. Backup and Restore When it comes to restoring Event Store from a backup, Event Store loads the persistent indexes, and finds out the highest logical position covered in the index. Event Store then creates a memtable from that point forward, this process is asynchronous and does not hold up start up."

The HTTP examples use cURL, but you can read Atom feeds with a wide variety of applications and languages. This second step covers reading events from a stream and subscribing to changes to events in a stream. Read a Stream of Events Event Store exposes all streams as atom feeds , and you can read data from the stream by navigating to the head URI of the stream http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/<STREAM_ID > with cURL, or click the Stream Browser tab in the Admin UI and you see the stream you created in step 1.

You can use the HTTP API to paginate through the feed using previous and next links within the stream. Or you can use a read method of the .NET API (and JVM client), to loop through events a certain number at a time. Subscribing to Receive Stream Updates A common operation is to subscribe to a stream and receive notifications for changes. As new events arrive, you continue following them. You can create subscriptions and watch events as they arrive under the Persistent Subscriptions tab, or use an API method: HTTP API .NET API JVM Client API curl -i -X PUT -d $'{\"startFrom\": 0,\"resolveLinktos\": false}' http://localhost:2113/subscriptions/newstream/examplegroup -u admin:changeit -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Next Steps Find more details on the parameters used in the example above, read the API documentation for PersistentSubscriptionSettings , CreatePersistentSubscriptionAsync and ConnectToPersistentSubscription <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/jvm-client/SubscriptionExample.java --> <!-- TODO: The dotnet example has reading events as they are added to subscription, HTTP does not, expand? --> <!-- TODO: And write more events, then what etc --> There are three types of subscription patterns, useful in different situations. Volatile Subscriptions This subscription calls a given function for events written after establishing the subscription. They are useful when you need notification of new events with minimal latency, but where it's not necessary to process every event. <!-- TODO: Example needed? --> For example, if a stream has 100 events in it when a subscriber connects, the subscriber can expect to see event number 101 onwards until the time the subscription is closed or dropped. Catch-Up Subscriptions This subscription specifies a starting point, in the form of an event number or transaction file position. You call the function for events from the starting point until the end of the stream, and then for subsequently written events. <!-- TODO: Example needed? --> For example, if you specify a starting point of 50 when a stream has 100 events, the subscriber can expect to see events 51 through 100, and then any events are subsequently written until you drop or close the subscription. Persistent Subscriptions Note Persistent subscriptions exist in version 3.2.0 and above of Event Store. This subscription supports the \" competing consumers \" messaging pattern and are useful when you need to distribute messages to many workers. Event Store saves the subscription state server-side and allows for at-least-once delivery guarantees across multiple consumers on the same stream. It is possible to have many groups of consumers compete on the same stream, with each group getting an at-least-once guarantee. <!-- TODO: Example needed? --> Next Step In this second part of our getting started guide you learned how to read events from a stream and subscribe to changes. The next part covers projections, used to give you continuous queries of your data. Step 3 - Projections"

Note The described is for development and evaluation of Event Store. It does not describe a production setup. The HTTP examples use cURL, but you can read Atom feeds with a wide variety of applications and languages. This first step covers installation and running Event Store, and writing your first event. Install and run Event Store Note Unless you pass a database option with --db , Event Store writes to a new database created in the host system's temporary files path each time it is started. For more information on Command Line Arguments read this guide . Windows Linux Docker Kubernetes macOS The prerequisites for Installing on Windows are: NET Framework 4.0+ Windows platform SDK with compilers (v7.1) or Visual C++ installed (Only required for a full build) Event Store has Chocolatey packages available that you can install with the following command: choco install eventstore-oss You can also download a binary, unzip the archive and run from the folder location with an administrator console: EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --db ./db --log ./logs This command starts Event Store with the database stored at the path ./db and the logs in ./logs . You can view further command line arguments in the server docs . Event Store runs in an administration context because it starts an HTTP server through http.sys . For permanent or production instances you need to provide an ACL such as: netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:2113/ user=DOMAIN\\username The prerequisites for Installing on Linux are: We recommend Mono 5.16.0 , but other versions may also work. Event Store has pre-built packages available for Debian-based distributions , manual instructions for distributions that use RPM , or you can build from source . The final package name to install is eventstore-oss . If you installed from a pre-built package, start Event Store with: sudo systemctl start eventstore When you install the Event Store package, the service doesn't start by default. This is to allow you to change the configuration, located at /etc/eventstore/eventstore.conf and to prevent creating a default database. In all other cases you can run the Event Store binary or use our run-node.sh shell script which exports the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the installation path of Event Store, which is necessary if you are planning to use projections. ./run-node.sh --db ./ESData Note We recommend that when using Linux you set the 'open file limit' to a high number. The precise value depends on your use case, but at least between 30,000 and 60,000 . Event Store has a Docker image available for any platform that supports Docker: docker run --name eventstore-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore Event Store has a Helm chart available for installing Event Store on Kubernetes clusters: helm repo add eventstore https://eventstore.github.io/EventStore.Charts helm repo update helm install -n eventstore eventstore/eventstore Note Read this guide for more details on how to use the helm chart. Read this guide for more details on using Kubernetes with AKS and this guide for more details on using Kubernetes with GKE. Event Store has a macOS package you can download and install, and we maintain a Homebrew Cask formula you can install: brew cask install eventstore In each case you can run Event Store with the eventstore command, and stop it with Ctrl+c . To use the default database location you need to use sudo , or you can change the location with the --db parameter. Interacting with an Event Store Server There are three ways to interact with Event Store: With the Admin UI . With the HTTP API . With a Client API, which you need to install first. Our documentation covers the .NET Core client API and the JVM client but others are available. .NET Client JVM Client Install the .NET Core client API using your preferred method, add it to your project: dotnet add package EventStore.Client And require it in your code: using EventStore.ClientAPI; Add the JVM client using Maven: <dependency> <groupId>com.geteventstore</groupId> <artifactId>eventstore-client_2.12</artifactId> <version>5.0.8</version> </dependency> And require it in your code: import eventstore.*; Connecting to Event Store If you want to use the Admin UI or the HTTP API, then you use port 2113 . For example, http://127.0.0.1:2113/ in your web browser, or curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113 for the HTTP API. Tip The default username and password is admin:changeit To use a client API, you use port 1113 and create a connection: .NET Client JVM Client When using the .NET client, you also need to give the connection a name. <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Next Steps In this example we used the EventStoreConnection.Create() overloaded method but others are available . <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/jvm-client//WriteEventExample.java --> Note For our JVM examples we use akka , a toolkit for building highly concurrent and distributed JVM applications. Writing Events to an Event Stream Event Store operates on a concept of Event Streams, and the first operation we look at is how to write to a stream. If you are Event Sourcing a domain model, a stream equates to an aggregate function. Event Store can handle hundreds of millions of streams, so create as many as you need. If you post to a stream that doesn't exist, Event Store creates it before adding the events. You can write events using the Admin UI by clicking the Stream Browser tab, the Add Event button, filling in the form with relevant values and clicking the Add button at the bottom of the page. Open a text editor, copy and paste the following event definition, and save it as event.json . [ { \"eventId\": \"fbf4a1a1-b4a3-4dfe-a01f-ec52c34e16e4\", \"eventType\": \"event-type\", \"data\": { \"a\": \"1\" } } ] HTTP API .NET API JVM Client Use the following cURL command, passing the name of the stream and the events to write: curl -i -d \"@event.json\" \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\" -H \"Content-Type:application/vnd.eventstore.events+json\" Next Steps Read this guide for more information on how to write events with the HTTP API. Note You can also post events to the HTTP API as XML, by changing the Content-Type header to XML . To use the .NET API, use the following method, passing the name of the stream, the version, and the events to write: <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Next Steps Read this guide for more information on how to write events with the .NET API.

Instead of the client polling every 5 seconds to get data from the feed the client sends a request with ES-LongPoll: 15 .

    "title": "Caching | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Caching As there are large differences between running Event Store in development and production, it's important to understand how caching works. Most of the URIs that Event Store emits are immutable (including the UI and Atom Feeds). An Atom feed has a URI that represents an event, e.g., /streams/foo/0 , representing 'event 0'. The data for event 0 never changes. If this stream is open to public reads then the URI is set to be 'cachable' for long periods of time. You can see a similar example in reading a feed. If a stream has 50 events in it, the feed page 20/forward/10 never changes, it will always be events 20-30. Internally Event Store controls serving the right URIs by using rel links with feeds (for example prev / next ). This caching behaviour is great for performance in a production environment and we recommended you use it, but in a developer environment it can become confusing. For example, what happens if you started a database, wrote /streams/foo/0 and performed a GET request? The GET request is cachable and now in your cache. Since this is a development environment, you shutdown Event Store and delete the database. You then restart Event Store and write a different event to /streams/foo/0 . You open your browser and inspect the /streams/foo/0 stream, and you see the event written before you deleted the database. To avoid this during development it's best to run Event Store with the --disable-http-caching command line option. This disables all caching and solve the issue."

First, create a certificate using powershell, and copy the thumbprint from the output New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName eventstore.org, localhost -CertStoreLocation cert:\\CurrentUser\\My To trust the new certificate, the certificate you have to import the certificate into the Trusted Root Certification Authorities: Press WindowsKey + R , and enter 'certmgr.msc'. Navigate to Certificates -> Current User -> Personal -> Certificates . Locate the certificate 'eventstore.org'. Right click on the certificate and click on All Tasks -> Export . Follow the prompts. Navigate to Certificates -> Current User -> Trusted Root Certification Authorities -> Certificates . Right click on the Certificates folder menu item and click All Tasks -> Import . Follow the prompts. Start Event Store with the following configuration in a configuration file : CertificateStoreLocation: CurrentUser CertificateStoreName: My CertificateThumbPrint: {Insert Thumb Print from Step 1} CertificateSubjectName: CN=eventstore.org ExtSecureTcpPort: 1115 Connect to Event Store: .NET API HTTP API var settings = ConnectionSettings.Create().UseSslConnection(\"eventstore.org\", true); using (var conn = EventStoreConnection.Create(settings, new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1115))) { conn.ConnectAsync().Wait(); } curl -vk --cert <PATH_TO_CERT> --key <PATH_TO_KEY> -i -d \"@event.json\" \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\" -H \"Content-Type:application/vnd.eventstore.events+json\" Setting up SSL on Linux Note This guide uses the latest Ubuntu LTS (18.04) First, create a private key and self-signed certificate request (This is only for testing purposes) openssl req \\ -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -subj \"/CN=eventstore.org\" \\ -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout eventstore.pem -out eventstore.csr Export a p12 file from the certificate request. You use this when starting Event Store: openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey eventstore.pem -in eventstore.csr -out eventstore.p12 You need to add the certificate to Ubuntu's trusted certificates. Copy the cert to the ca-certificates folder and update the certificates: sudo cp eventstore.csr /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/eventstore.crt sudo update-ca-certificates The mono framework has its own separate certificate store which you need to sync with the changes you made to Ubuntu's certificates. You first need to install mono-devel : sudo apt-get install mono-devel This process installs cert-sync , which you use to update mono's certificate store with the new certificate: sudo cert-sync eventstore.csr Start Event Store with the following configuration in a configuration file : CertificateFile: eventstore.p12 ExtSecureTcpPort: 1115 Connect to Event Store: .NET API HTTP API var settings = ConnectionSettings.Create().UseSslConnection(\"eventstore.org\", true); using (var conn = EventStoreConnection.Create(settings, new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1115))) { conn.ConnectAsync().Wait(); } curl -vk --cert <PATH_TO_CERT> --key <PATH_TO_KEY> -i -d \"@event.json\" \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\" -H \"Content-Type:application/vnd.eventstore.events+json\""

    "title": "Ports and networking | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Ports and networking Single Node If you run Event Store as a single node, it only uses two ports. The first port is the external HTTP port, and the default value is 2113 . Event Store uses this port for both the client HTTP APIs and for the management HTTP interface. The second port used is the TCP interface for clients connecting over the client API, and the default for the port is 1113 . Event Store in Windows tries to add access via http.sys automatically for the 2113 port. You should ensure that these ports are open and allowed via a firewall. Cluster Node When running in cluster mode the networking for Event Store is more complex. Cluster mode requires 4 ports to run. The ports are for internal HTTP, internal TCP, external HTTP, and external TCP. <!-- TODO: And they are? --> The internal and external interfaces allow for separation of traffic. The internal network is where cluster communications runs, while the external interfaces is where client communications runs. This separation allows for more secure setups such as putting internal communications on a different network than external client communications. For example, you might want to allow clients over HTTP to talk directly to Event Store, and you can move internal communications to a separate network to ensure the management interface and internal operations are not accessible to external traffic. The external TCP and HTTP ports are similar to the HTTP and TCP ports of a single node deploy. Event Store runs client requests over the HTTP API through the external HTTP port. You can run without the management API on the external interface (internal only). The external and the internal interfaces support the gossip protocol. You can control whether the admin interface is available on the external HTTP interface using the admin-on-ext option . You can control whether gossip is enabled on external interfaces with the gossip-on-ext option (you normally want it enabled). You configure the internal TCP and HTTP ports in the same way as the external. All internal communications for the cluster happen over these interfaces. Elections and internal gossip happen over HTTP. Replication and forwarding of client requests happens over the TCP channel. When setting up a cluster the nodes must be able to reach each other over both the internal HTTP channel and the internal TCP channel. You should ensure that these ports are open on firewalls on the machines and between the machines. Heartbeat Timeouts Event Store uses heartbeats over all TCP connections to discover dead clients and nodes. Setting heartbeat timeouts requires thought. Set them too short and you receive false positives, set them too long and discovery of dead clients and nodes is slower. Each heartbeat has two points of configuration. The first is the 'interval', this represents how often the system should consider a heartbeat. Event Store doesn't send a heartbeat for every interval. Event Store sends heartbeat requests if it has not heard from a node within the configured interval. On a busy cluster, you may never see any heartbeats. The second point of configuration is the 'timeout'. This determines how long Event Store waits for a client or node to respond to a heartbeat request. Different environments need different values for these settings. While low numbers work well on a LAN they tend to not work well in the cloud. The defaults are likely fine on a LAN, for the cloud, consider setting: An interval of 5000ms. A timeout of 1000ms. Tip If in doubt, choose higher numbers. This adds a small period of time to discover a dead client or node and is better than the alternative, which is false positives. Advertise As Due to NAT, or other reasons a node may not be bound to the address it is reachable from other nodes. For example, the machine has an IP address of 192.168.1.13, but the node is visible to other nodes as 10.114.12.112. The option advertise-as allows you to tell the node that even though it is bound to a given address it should not gossip that address. Instead it uses the address that you tell it to use. In the example above you would configure\" --ext-ip 192.168.1.13 --advertise-as 10.114.12.112 Or use the equivalent configuration via environment variables or a configuration file."

    "title": "Metadata and Reserved Names | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Metadata and Reserved Names Stream Metadata Every stream in Event Store has metadata associated with it. Event Store allows you to change some values in the metadata, and you can write your own data into stream metadata that you can refer to in your code. Reserved Names All internal data used by Event Store is prefixed with a $ character (for example $maxCount on a stream's metadata). Because of this you should not use names with a $ prefix as event names, metadata keys, or stream names, except where detailed below. The supported internal settings are: Name Description $maxAge Sets a sliding window based on dates. When data reaches a certain age it disappears automatically from the stream and is considered eligible for scavenging. This value is set as an integer representing the number of seconds. This value must be >=1. $maxCount Sets a sliding window based on the number of items in the stream. When data reaches a certain length it disappears automatically from the stream and is considered eligible for scavenging. This value is set as an integer representing the count of items. This value must be >= 1. $cacheControl This controls the cache of the head of a stream. Most URIs in a stream are infinitely cacheable but the head by default will not cache. It may be preferable in some situations to set a small amount of caching on the head to allow intermediaries to handle polls (say 10 seconds). The argument is an integer representing the seconds to cache. This value must be >= 1. Note If you set both $maxAge and $maxCount then events will become eligible for scavenging when either criteria is met. For example, if you set $maxAge to 10 and $maxCount to 50,000, events will be marked as eligible for scavenging after either 10 seconds, or 50,000 events, have passed. Deleted items will only be removed once the scavenge process runs. Security access control lists are also included in the $acl section of the stream metadata. Name Description $r The list of users with read permissions $w The list of users with write permissions $d The list of users with delete permissions $mw The list of users with write permissions to stream metadata $mr The list of users with read permissions to stream metadata You can find more details on access control lists can here . Event Metadata Every event in Event Store has metadata associated with it. Event Store allows you to change some values in the metadata, and you can write your own data into event metadata that you can refer to in your code. All names starting with $ are reserved space for internal use. The currently supported reserved internal names are: $correlationId The application level correlation ID associated with this message. $causationId The application level causation ID associated with this message. Projections honor both the correlationId and causationId patterns for any events it produces internally (linkTo/emit/etc)."

    "title": "Running Event Store | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Running Event Store Event Store runs as a server that clients can connect to either over HTTP or using one of the client APIs . You can run both the open source and commercial versions as either a single node or a highly available cluster of nodes. We distribute an open source version of Event Store as a console application. There are separate distributions for Windows on .NET and Linux/macOS on Mono. Install and run Event Store Note Unless you pass a database option with --db , Event Store writes to a new database created in the host system's temporary files path each time it is started. For more information on Command Line Arguments read this guide . Windows Linux Docker Kubernetes macOS The prerequisites for Installing on Windows are: NET Framework 4.0+ Windows platform SDK with compilers (v7.1) or Visual C++ installed (Only required for a full build) Event Store has Chocolatey packages available that you can install with the following command: choco install eventstore-oss You can also download a binary, unzip the archive and run from the folder location with an administrator console: EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --db ./db --log ./logs This command starts Event Store with the database stored at the path ./db and the logs in ./logs . You can view further command line arguments in the server docs . Event Store runs in an administration context because it starts an HTTP server through http.sys . For permanent or production instances you need to provide an ACL such as: netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:2113/ user=DOMAIN\\username The prerequisites for Installing on Linux are: We recommend Mono 5.16.0 , but other versions may also work. Event Store has pre-built packages available for Debian-based distributions , manual instructions for distributions that use RPM , or you can build from source . The final package name to install is eventstore-oss . If you installed from a pre-built package, start Event Store with: sudo systemctl start eventstore When you install the Event Store package, the service doesn't start by default. This is to allow you to change the configuration, located at /etc/eventstore/eventstore.conf and to prevent creating a default database. In all other cases you can run the Event Store binary or use our run-node.sh shell script which exports the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the installation path of Event Store, which is necessary if you are planning to use projections. ./run-node.sh --db ./ESData Note We recommend that when using Linux you set the 'open file limit' to a high number. The precise value depends on your use case, but at least between 30,000 and 60,000 . Event Store has a Docker image available for any platform that supports Docker: docker run --name eventstore-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore Event Store has a Helm chart available for installing Event Store on Kubernetes clusters: helm repo add eventstore https://eventstore.github.io/EventStore.Charts helm repo update helm install -n eventstore eventstore/eventstore Note Read this guide for more details on how to use the helm chart. Read this guide for more details on using Kubernetes with AKS and this guide for more details on using Kubernetes with GKE. Event Store has a macOS package you can download and install, and we maintain a Homebrew Cask formula you can install: brew cask install eventstore In each case you can run Event Store with the eventstore command, and stop it with Ctrl+c . To use the default database location you need to use sudo , or you can change the location with the --db parameter. Solving 503 errors from the Admin UI There is a known issue with the .NET HTTPListener class (which Event Store uses) and bad URL ACL registrations which can cause servers to return 503 errors for every request. If you see this, you can issue the following commands: netsh http show urlacl Look for an entry on the port you're trying to use ( 2113 unless you've specified a custom port), then issue: netsh http delete urlacl <the entry you just found> For example: netsh http delete urlacl http://+:2113/ These steps should resolve the issue. Shutting down an Event Store node Event Store is designed to be safe by default, and it is expected that it will be shut down using kill -9 . It is also possible to initiate a shutdown via the Admin UI, by clicking on the Shutdown Server button located on the Admin page. This may be useful if you do not have console access to the node or need to script initiating a shutdown. Securing Event Store To secure Event Store, you can bind the server to the localhost interface and install a reverse proxy such as nginx or Varnish on the public IP. Read this guide for an example of setting up Event Store with Varnish. The reverse proxy is your public interface. Internally it handles the authentication and route requests to Event Store. Event Store is only accessible through the localhost adapter and is not exposed publicly. The locally running reverse proxy is allowed to cache responses, and because of this, reverse proxies are more performant than calling Event Store directly. Even if you use a reverse proxy, you can support external authentication from Event Store itself. You do this by enabling the ES-TrustedAuth trusted intermediary option in your configuration. This allows the intermediary to write a header with the user information that Event Store uses."

    "title": "Command Line Arguments | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Command Line Arguments Event Store supports many configuration options. There are three distinct ways to set any parameter, all with their own advantages and disadvantages. The command line Environment variables YAML files Command line To pass a configuration value over the command line you add the configuration to the line executing Event Store, for example: EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --log ~/logs While command line arguments are useful during development, they are not the preferred way to handle configuration in a production system. Environment Variables You can set all arguments can also as environment variables. This mechanism is often used in UNIX based systems. For example: log=~/logs You can reference another environment variable by setting the variable’s value to ${env:REFERENCED_ENV_VAR} . For example, if you’re using Azure Service Fabric, some predefined environment variables exist. You can use EVENTSTORE_EXT_IP={env:Fabric_NodeIPOrFQDN} to reference the node's IP address. YAML Files The last way you can set arguments is to put them into one or more configuration files. To tell Event Store to use a different configuration file, you pass the file path on the command line with --config=filename , or use the CONFIG enivornment variable. The basic format of the YAML configuration file is as follows: --- Log: \"~/logs\" IntHttpPort: 2111 --- Note You need to use the three dashes and spacing in your YAML file. YAML files are better for large installations as you can centrally distribute and manage them, or generate them from a configuration management system. Order of precedence The order of precedence between multiple configuration sources is important as you can set them in multiple ways. The command line is the highest priority followed by environment variables. Files are the lowest precedence and are processed in the order given on the command line.

    "keywords": "Rebuilding Indexes As of version 3.9.0 all future indexes use 64-bit hashes instead of 32-bit hashes. Event Store automatically transitions your indexes from 32-bit to 64-bit by writing all new indexes as 64-bit indexes during the merge process. If you prefer to use only 64-bit indexes immediately you can force this change. For a small database, delete the index folder in your database folder, and let it rebuild (this might take a while) If you have a large database, or it's stored in remote storage, and you can't lose downtime, you can run this operation offline on another node with the following steps: Take a back up . Restore the backup to fast local disks. Delete the index folder from back up. Run Event Store with a cluster size 3 to prevent other writes. It will rebuild the index. Restore the index back to a node ( index folder). Let Event Store catch up from master. Repeat the restore for other nodes. For other indices, your index will change to 64-bit due to the merging process that occurs over time."

UI, .NET, HTTP etc --> By changing these settings, you can lessen the amount of pressure projections put on an Event Store node or improve projection performance. You can change these settings on a case-by-case basis, and monitor potential improvements. Note You can only change the configuration of a stopped projection. You change the configuration of a projection by setting the relevant key and value in a request, or when you create a projection with the web admin interface. HTTP API .NET Client <!-- TODO: Further explanation here --> curl -i --data-binary \"@xbox-one-s-counter.json\" http://localhost:2113/projections/continuous?name=xbox-one-s-counter%26type=js%26enabled=true%26emit=true%26trackemittedstreams=true -u admin:changeit <!-- TODO: Further explanation here --> <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> <!-- ## [JVM Client](#tab/tabid-7) --> <!-- TODO: Exists? --> Emit options These options control how projections write events. In busy systems, projections can put a lot of extra pressure on the master node. This is especially true for Event Store servers that also have persistent subscriptions running, which only the master node can process. If you see a lot of commit timeouts and slow writes from your projections and other clients, then start with these settings. Emit Enabled The emit boolean setting determines whether a projection can emit events and any projection that calls emit() or linkTo() requires it. If this option is not set and a projection attempts to emit events, you see an error message like the following: <!-- TODO: Is it emit or emitenabled? Or are .NET and HTTP different --> 'emit' is not allowed by the projection/configuration/mode Event Store disables this setting by default, and is usually set when you create the projection and if you need the projection to emit events. Track Emitted Streams The trackemittedstreams boolean setting enables tracking of a projection's emitted streams. It only has an affect if the projection has EmitEnabled enabled. Tracking emitted streams enables you to delete a projection and all the streams that it has created. You should only the setting if you intend to delete a projection and create new ones that project to the same stream. Warning By default Event Store disables the trackemittedstreams setting for projections. When enabled, an event written records the stream name (in $projections-{projection_name}-emittedstreams ) of each event emitted by the projection. This means that write amplification is a possibility, as each event that the projection emits writes a separate event. As such, this option is not recommended for projections that emit a lot of events, and you should enable only where necessary. Tip Between Event Store versions 3.8.0 and 4.0.2, this option was enabled by default when a projection was created through the UI. If you have any projections created during this time frame, it's worth checking whether this option is enabled. Max Allowed Writes in Flight <!-- TODO: Why is this not in the GUI for new projection? --> <!-- TODO: Is the setting name correct? Especially in HTTP --> The AllowedInFlightMessages setting sets the maximum number of writes to allow for a projection. Because a projection can write to multiple different streams, it's possible for the projection to send multiple writes at the same time. This option sets the number of concurrent writes that a projection can perform. By default, projections try to perform writes as quickly as they come. This can add a lot of pressure to a node, especially for projections that emit to many different streams. If you see your projections causing frequent commit timeouts or slow reads, you can try lowering this value to see if there is any improvement. Note Lower values may cause the projection to slow down as the number of writes are throttled, but the trade off for this is cleaner logs and fewer commit timeouts. By default, this is unbounded, allowing a projection to write as fast as it can. Max Write Batch Length <!-- TODO: Why is this not in the GUI for new projection? --> <!-- TODO: Is the setting name correct? Especially in HTTP --> The MaxWriteBatchLength setting sets the maximum number of events the projection can write in a batch at a time. The default for this option is 500. Checkpoint options Checkpoints store how far along a projection is in the streams it is processing from. There is a performance overhead with writing a checkpoint, as it does more than write an event, and writing them too often can slow projections down. We recommend you try other methods of improving projections before changing these values, as checkpoints are an important part of running projections. Checkpoint After Ms The CheckpointAfterMs setting prevents a new checkpoint from being written within a certain time frame from the previous one. The setting is to keep a projection from writing too many checkpoints too quickly, something that can happen in a busy system. The default setting is 0 seconds, which means there is no limit to how quickly checkpoints can be written. Checkpoint Handled Threshold The CheckpointHandledThreshold setting controls the number of events that a projection can handle before attempting to write a checkpoint. An event is considered handled if it actually passed through the projection's filter. If the projection is set to checkpoint every 4,000 events, but it only reads from the foo stream, the projection only checkpoints every 4,000 foo events. The default setting is 4,000 events. Checkpoint Unhandled Bytes Threshold The CheckpointUnhandledBytesThreshold setting specifies the number of bytes a projection can process before attempting to write a checkpoint. Unhandled bytes are the events that are not processed by the projection itself. For example, if the projection reads from the foo stream, but writes from the bar stream comes through, a checkpoint is written after this number of bytes have been processed. This prevents the projection from having to read through a potentially large number of unrelated events again because none of them passed its filter. The default setting is 10mb. Processing options Pending Events Threshold The PendingEventsThreshold setting determines the number of events that can be pending before the projection is paused. Pausing the projection stops the projection from reading, allowing it to finish with the current events that are waiting to be processed. Once the pending queue has drained to half the threshold, the projection starts reading again. The default setting is 5000."

    "title": "Introduction to Projections | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Introduction to Projections Projections is an Event Store subsystem that lets you write new events or link existing events to streams in a reactive manner. Projections are good at solving one specific query type, a category known as 'temporal correlation queries'. This query type is common in business systems and few can execute these queries well. Note Projections require the event body to be in JSON. Business Case Examples For example. You are looking for how many Twitter users said \"happy\" within 5 minutes of the word \"foo coffee shop\" and within 2 minutes of saying \"london\". This is the type of query that projections can solve. Let's try a more complex business problem. As a medical research doctor you want to find people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer within the last year. During their treatment a patient should not have had any proxies for a heart condition such as taking aspirin every morning. Within three weeks of their diagnosis they should have been put on treatment X. Within one month after starting the treatment they should have failed with a lab result that looks like L1. Within another six weeks they should have been put on treatment Y, and within four weeks failed that treatment with a lab result that looks like L2. You can use projections in nearly all examples of near real-time complex event processing. There are a large number of problems that fit into this category from monitoring of temperature sensors, to reacting to changes in the stock market. It's important to remember the types of problems that projections help to solve. Many problems are not a good fit for projections and are better served by hosting another read model populated by a catchup subscription . Continuous Querying Projections support the concept of continuous queries. When running a projection you can choose whether the query should run and give you all results present, or whether the query should continue running into the future finding new results as they happen and updating its result set. In the medical example above the doctor could leave the query running to be notified of any new patients that meet the criteria. The output of all queries is a stream, this stream can be listened to like any other stream. Types of Projections There are 2 types of projections in Event Store: Built in (system) projections written in C#. User-defined JavaScript projections which you create via the API or the admin UI."

Logging from within a Projection For debugging purposes, projections includes a log method which, when called, sends messages to the configured Event Store logger (the default is NLog , to a file, and stdout ). You might find printing out the structure of the event body for inspection useful. For example: fromStream('$stats-127.0.0.1:2113') .when({ $any: function(s,e){ log(JSON.stringify(e)); } }) Creating a sample projection for debugging purposes Filename: stats-counter.json Contents: fromStream('$stats-127.0.0.1:2113') .when({ $init: function(){ return { count: 0 } }, $any: function(s,e){ s.count += 1; } }) You create the projection by making a call to the API and providing it with the definition of the projection. curl -i -d@stats-counter.json http://localhost:2113/projections/continuous?name=stats-counter%26type=js%26enabled=true%26emit=true%26trackemittedstreams=true -u admin:changeit Debugging your first projection Once the projection is running, open your browser and enable the developer tools. Once you have the developer tools open, visit your projection URL and you should see a button labelled Debug . After clicking the projection \"Debug\" button, you see the debugging interface with the definition of the projection and information about the events the projection is processing on the right hand side. At the top there are couple of buttons to take note of, specifically the Run Step and Update buttons. You use Run Step to step through the event waiting in the queue, placing you in projection debugging mode. The Update button provides you with a way to update the projection definition without having to go back to the projection itself and leave the context of the debugger. If the Run Step button is not greyed out and you click it, the browser has hit a breakpoint. You are now able to step through the projection, the important method to step into is the handler(state, eventEnvelope) method."

This final step covers the different APIs, and client SDKs Event Store has available with the aim of helping you choose which one suits your use case. TCP Event Store offers a low-level protocol in the form of an asynchronous TCP protocol that exchanges protobuf objects. At present this protocol has adapters for .NET and the JVM. Event Store Supported Clients .NET Client JVM Client Community Developed Clients .NET Core Node.js Node.js Node.js Haskell Erlang F# Elixir Java 8 Maven plugin Rust Go HTTP Event Store also offers an HTTP-based interface, based specifically on the AtomPub protocol . As it operates over HTTP, this is less efficient, but nearly every environment supports it. Event Store Supported Clients HTTP API Community Developed Clients PHP Python Ruby Go If you have a client to add, click the 'Improve this Doc' link on the top right of the page to submit a pull request. Which to use? Many factors go into the choice of which of the protocols (TCP vs. HTTP) to use. Both have their strengths and weaknesses. TCP is faster This speed especially applies to subscribers as events pushed to the subscriber, whereas with Atom the subscribers poll the head of the atom feed to check if new events are available. The difference can be as high as 2–3 times higher (sub 10ms for TCP, vs. seconds for Atom). Also, the number of writes per second supported is often dramatically higher when using TCP. At the time of writing, standard Event Store appliances can service around 2000 writes/second over HTTP compared to 15,000-20,000/second over TCP. This increase might be a deciding factor if you are in a high-performance environment. AtomPub is more scalable for large numbers of subscribers This scalability is due to the ability to use intermediary caching with Atom feeds. Most URIs returned by Event Store point to immutable data and are infinitely cachable. Therefore on a replay of a projection, much of the data required is likely available on a local or intermediary cache. This can also lead to lower network traffic. Atom tends to operate better in a large heterogeneous environment where you have callers from different platforms. This is especially true if you have to integrate with different teams or external vendors. Atom is an industry standard and well-documented protocol whereas the TCP protocol is a custom protocol they would need to understand. Most platforms have good existing tooling for Atom including feed readers. None of this tooling exists for analyzing traffic with the TCP protocol. Note Our recommendation would be to use AtomPub as your primary protocol unless you have low subscriber SLAs or need higher throughput on reads and writes than Atom can offer. This is due to the open nature and ease of use of the Atom protocol. Often in integration scenarios, these are more important than raw performance. Next Step Congratulations!

Writing your first projection Tip Read this guide to find out more about the user defined projection's API. The projection counts the number of 'XBox One S's that customers added to their shopping carts. A Projection starts with a selector, in this case fromAll() . Another possibility is fromCategory({category}) which this step discusses later, but for now, fromAll should do. The second part of a projection is a set of filters. There is a special filter called $init that sets up an initial state. You want to start a counter from 0 and each time Event Store observes an ItemAdded event for an 'Xbox One S,' increment the counter. Here is the projection, you can download it as a file here : fromAll() .when({ $init: function(){ return { count: 0 } }, ItemAdded: function(s,e){ if(e.body.Description.indexOf(\"Xbox One S\") >= 0){ s.count += 1; } } }) You create a projection by calling the projection API and providing it with the definition of the projection. Here you decide how to run the projection, declaring that you want the projection to start from the beginning and keep running. You can create a projection using the Admin UI by opening the Projections tab, clicking the New Projection button and filling in the details of your projection. And to use the HTTP or .NET API: HTTP API .NET API curl -i --data-binary \"@xbox-one-s-counter.json\" http://localhost:2113/projections/continuous?name=xbox-one-s-counter%26type=js%26enabled=true%26emit=true%26trackemittedstreams=true -u admin:changeit Next Steps read here for more information on creating projections with the HTTP API and the parameters available, or our projections section for details on projection syntax. <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Next Steps read here for more information on creating projections with the .NET API and the parameters available, or our projections section for details on projection syntax. Querying for the state of the projection Now the projection is running, you can query the state of the projection. As this projection has a single state, query it with the following request: HTTP API .NET API Response curl -i http://localhost:2113/projection/xbox-one-s-counter/state <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> { \"count\": 3 } Writing to Streams from Projections The above gives you the correct result but requires you to poll for the state of a projection. What if you wanted Event Store to notify you about state updates via subscriptions? Output State Update the projection to output the state to a stream by calling the outputState() method on the projection which by default produces a $projections-{projection-name}-result stream. Below is the updated projection, you can download it as a file here : fromAll() .when({ $init: function(){ return { count: 0 } }, ItemAdded: function(s,e){ if(e.body.Description.indexOf(\"Xbox One S\") >= 0){ s.count += 1; } } }).outputState() To update the projection, edit the projection definition in the Admin UI, or issue the following request: HTTP API .NET API curl -i -X PUT --data-binary @\"xbox-one-s-counter-outputState.json\" http://localhost:2113/projection/xbox-one-s-counter/query?emit=yes -u admin:changeit <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Then reset the projection you created above: HTTP API .NET API Response curl -i -X POST \"http://localhost:2113/projection/xbox-one-s-counter/command/reset\" -H \"accept:application/json\" -H \"Content-Length:0\" -u admin:changeit <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> { \"msgTypeId\": 293, \"name\": \"xbox-one-s-counter\" } You can now read the events in the result stream by issuing a read request. HTTP API .NET API Response curl -i \"http://localhost:2113/streams/\\$projections-xbox-one-s-counter-result?embed=body\" -H \"accept:application/json\" -u admin:changeit | grep data <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> \"data\": \"{\\\"count\\\":3}\", \"data\": \"{\\\"count\\\":2}\", \"data\": \"{\\\"count\\\":1}\", Configure Projection Properties You can configure properties of the projection by updating values of the options object. For example, the following projection changes the name of the results stream, you can download it as a file here : options({ resultStreamName: \"xboxes\" }) fromAll() .when({ $init: function(){ return { count: 0 } }, ItemAdded: function(s,e){ if(e.body.Description.indexOf(\"Xbox One S\") >= 0){ s.count += 1; } } }).outputState() Then send the update to the projection: HTTP API .NET API curl -i -X PUT -d \"@update-projection-options.json\" http://localhost:2113/projection/xbox-one-s-counter/query?emit=yes -u admin:changeit <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Tip You can find all the options available in the user defined projections guide . Now you can read the result as above, but use the new stream name: HTTP API .NET API curl -i \"http://localhost:2113/streams/xboxes?embed=body\" -H \"accept:application/json\" -u admin:changeit | grep data <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> The Number of items per shopping cart The example in this step so far relied on a global state for the projection, but what if you wanted a count of the number of items in the shopping cart per shopping cart. Event Store has a built-in $by_category projection that lets you select events from a particular list of streams. Enable this projection with the following command. HTTP API .NET API curl -i -d{} http://localhost:2113/projection/%24by_category/command/enable -u admin:changeit <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> The projection links events from existing streams to new streams by splitting the stream name by a separator. You can configure the projection to specify the position of where to split the stream id and provide a separator. By default, the category splits the stream id by a dash. The category is the first string. Stream Name Category shoppingCart-54 shoppingCart shoppingCart-v1-54 shoppingCart shoppingCart No category as there is no separator You want to define a projection that produces a count per stream for a category, but the state needs to be per stream. To do so, use $by_category and it's fromCategory API method. Below is the projection, you can download the file here : fromCategory('shoppingCart') .foreachStream() .when({ $init: function(){ return { count: 0 } }, ItemAdded: function(s,e){ s.count += 1; } }) Create the projection with the following request: HTTP API .NET API curl -i --data-binary \"@shopping-cart-counter.json\" http://localhost:2113/projections/continuous?name=shopping-cart-item-counter%26type=js%26enabled=true%26emit=true%26trackemittedstreams=true -u admin:changeit <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> Querying for the state of the projection by partition Querying for the state of the projection is different due to the partitioning of the projection. You have to specify the partition and the name of the stream. HTTP API .NET API Response curl -i http://localhost:2113/projection/shopping-cart-item-counter/state?partition=shoppingCart-b989fe21-9469-4017-8d71-9820b8dd1164 <!-- Can not find reference ~/code-examples/dotnet-client/Program.cs --> { \"count\": 2 } Next Step In this third part of our getting started guide you learned about projections.

When creating these events, you need to provide the ES-EventType and ES-EventId headers and cannot have metadata associated with the event. In the example below SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ= is the data you POST to the stream: Request Response curl -i -d \"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=\" \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\" -H \"Content-Type:application/octet-stream\" -H \"ES-EventType:rawDataType\" -H \"ES-EventId:eeccf3ce-4f54-409d-8870-b35dd836cca6\" HTTP/1.1 201 Created Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTo, ES-ExpectedVersion Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position Location: http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Mon, 27 Jun 2016 13:15:27 GMT Content-Length: 0 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 Expected version header The expected version header represents the version of the stream you expect. For example if you write to a stream at version 1, then you expect it to be at version 1 next time you write. This can allow for optimistic locking when multiple applications are reading/writing to streams. If your expected version is not the current version you receive an HTTP status code of 400. Warning See the idempotency section below, if you post the same event twice it is idempotent and won't return a version error. First write an event to a stream, setting a version: [ { \"eventId\": \"fbf4b1a1-b4a3-4dfe-a01f-ec52c34e16e4\", \"eventType\": \"event-type\", \"data\": { \"a\": \"1\" } } ] Download Request Response curl -i -d @event-version.json \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\" -H \"Content-Type:application/vnd.eventstore.events+json\" -H \"ES-CurrentVersion: 0\" HTTP/1.1 201 Created Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Prefix, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTos Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position, ES-CurrentVersion Location: http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/2 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Tue, 14 Aug 2018 10:02:08 GMT Content-Length: 0 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 If you now write to the stream with the incorrect version, you receive an HTTP status code 400 error.

Idempotency Appends to streams are idempotent based upon the EventId assigned in your post. If you were to re-run the last command it returns the same value again. This is important behaviour as it's how you implement error handling. If you receive a timeout, broken connection, no answer, etc from your HTTP POST then it's your responsibility to retry the post. You must also keep the same UUID that you assigned to the event in the first POST . If you are using the expected version parameter with your post, then Event Store is 100% idempotent. If you use -2 as your expected version value, Event Store does its best to keep events idempotent but cannot assure that everything is fully idempotent and you end up in 'at-least-once' messaging. Read this guide for more details on idempotency."

    "title": "Stream Metadata | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Stream Metadata By default streams you create in Event Store have no metadata associated with it. Internally, the metadata includes information such as the ACL of the stream, the maximum count and age for the events in the stream. Client code can also add information into stream metadata for use with projections or the client API. A common use case is to store information associated with an event that is not part of the event. Examples of this are: Which user wrote the event. Which application server were they talking to. What IP address did the request come from? Stream metadata is stored internally as JSON, and you can access it over the HTTP API. Reading Stream Metadata To read the metadata, issue a GET request to the attached metadata resource, which is typically of the form: http://{eventstore-ip-address}/streams/{stream-name}/metadata You should not access metadata by constructing this URL yourself, as the right to change the resource address is reserved. Instead, you should follow the link from the stream itself, which enables your client to tolerate future changes to the addressing structure.

Event Store supplies these links so you can read through a stream, and they follow the pattern defined in RFC 5005 . In the example above the server returned the following links as part of its result: \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\", \"relation\": \"self\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/head/backward/20\", \"relation\": \"first\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/2/forward/20\", \"relation\": \"previous\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/metadata\", \"relation\": \"metadata\" } ], This shows that there is not a next URL as all the information is in this request and that the URL requested is the first link. When dealing with these URLs, there are two ways of reading the data in the stream. You GET the last link and move backwards following previous links, or You GET the first link and follow the next links, and the final item will not have a next link. If you want to follow a live stream, then you keep following the previous links. When you reach the end of a stream, you receive an empty document with no entries or previous link. You then continue polling this URI (in the future a document will appear). You can see this by trying the previous link from the above feed.

For example, if you request the last link from above: Request Response curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet/0/forward/20 -H \"Accept:application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Prefix, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTos Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position, ES-CurrentVersion Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, public Vary: Accept Content-Type: application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Tue, 21 Aug 2018 10:24:28 GMT Content-Length: 10403 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 { \"title\": \"Event stream 'alphabet'\", \"id\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet\", \"updated\": \"2018-08-21T09:53:46.869716Z\", \"streamId\": \"alphabet\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"EventStore\" }, \"headOfStream\": false, \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet\", \"relation\": \"self\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet/head/backward/20\", \"relation\": \"first\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet/20/forward/20\", \"relation\": \"previous\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet/metadata\", \"relation\": \"metadata\" } ], \"entries\": [ ] } You then follow previous links until you are back to the head of the stream, where you can continue reading events in real time by polling the previous link. Note All links except the head link are fully cacheable as you can see in the HTTP header Cache-Control: max-age=31536000, public . This is important when discussing intermediaries and performance as you commonly replay a stream from storage. You should never bookmark links aside from the head of the stream resource, and always follow links. We may in the future change how internal links work, and bookmarking links other than the head may break. Reading All Events $all is a special paged stream for all events. You can use the same paged form of reading described above to read all events for a node by pointing the stream at /streams/$all . As it's a stream like any other, you can perform all operations, except posting to it. Note To access the $all stream, you must use admin details, find more information on the security page. Request Response curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all -H \"Accept:application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" -u admin:changeit HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTo, ES-ExpectedVersion Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, must-revalidate Vary: Accept ETag: \"25159393;248368668\" Content-Type: application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Fri, 13 Mar 2015 16:19:09 GMT Content-Length: 12157 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 { \"title\": \"All events\", \"id\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all\">, \"updated\": \"2015-03-13T16:19:06.548415Z\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"EventStore\" }, \"headOfStream\": false, \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all\", \"relation\": \"self\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all/head/backward/20\", \"relation\": \"first\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all/00000000000000000000000000000000/forward/20\", \"relation\": \"last\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all/00000000017BC0D000000000017BC0D0/backward/20\", \"relation\": \"next\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all/0000000001801EBF0000000001801EBF/forward/20\", \"relation\": \"previous\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/%24all/metadata\", \"relation\": \"metadata\" } ], \"entries\": [] # TODO: Make complete Conditional Gets The head link supports conditional GET s with the use of ETAGS , a well-known HTTP construct. You can include the ETAG of your last request and issue a conditional GET to the server. If nothing has changed, it won't return the full feed. For example the earlier request has an ETAG: Request Response curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet -H \"Accept:application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" ETag: \"26;-2060438500\" You can use this in your next request when polling the stream for changes by putting it in the If-None-Match header. This tells the server to check if the response is the one you already know and returning a '304 not modified' response. If the tags have changed, the server returns a '200 OK' response. You can use this method to optimise your application by not sending large streams if there are no changes. Request Response curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/alphabet -H \"Accept:application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" -H \"If-None-Match:26;-2060438500\" HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Prefix, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTos Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position, ES-CurrentVersion Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Tue, 21 Aug 2018 12:07:35 GMT Content-Length: 0 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 Note You create Etags using the version of the stream and the media type of the stream you are reading. You can't read an Etag from a stream in one media type and use it with another media type. Embedding Data into Streams in JSON format So far in this guide, the feeds returned have contained links that refer to the actual event data. This is normally a preferable mechanism for several reasons: They can be in a different media type than the feed, and you can negotiate them separately from the feed itself (e.g., the feed in JSON, the event in XML). You can cache the event data separately from the feed, and you can point it to different feeds. If you use a linkTo() in your projection this is what happens in your atom feeds. If you are using JSON, you can embed the events into the atom feed events. This can help cut down on the number of requests in some situations, but the messages are larger. There are ways of embedding events and further metadata into your stream by using the embed= parameter. Rich embed mode The rich embed mode returns more properties about the event ( eventtype , streamid , position , etc.) as you can see in the following request. Request Response curl -i -H \"Accept:application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream?embed=rich\" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTo, ES-ExpectedVersion Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, must-revalidate Vary: Accept ETag: \"0;248368668\" Content-Type: application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Fri, 13 Mar 2015 16:30:57 GMT Content-Length: 1570 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 { \"title\": \"Event stream 'newstream'\", \"id\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\">, \"updated\": \"2015-03-13T12:13:42.492473Z\", \"streamId\": \"newstream\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"EventStore\" }, \"headOfStream\": true, \"selfUrl\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\">, \"eTag\": \"0;248368668\", \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\", \"relation\": \"self\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/head/backward/20\", \"relation\": \"first\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/1/forward/20\", \"relation\": \"previous\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/metadata\", \"relation\": \"metadata\" } ], \"entries\": [ { \"eventId\": \"fbf4a1a1-b4a3-4dfe-a01f-ec52c34e16e4\", \"eventType\": \"event-type\", \"eventNumber\": 0, \"streamId\": \"newstream\", \"isJson\": true, \"isMetaData\": false, \"isLinkMetaData\": false, \"positionEventNumber\": 0, \"positionStreamId\": \"newstream\", \"title\": \"0@newstream\", \"id\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0\">, \"updated\": \"2015-03-13T12:13:42.492473Z\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"EventStore\" }, \"summary\": \"event-type\", \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0\", \"relation\": \"edit\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0\", \"relation\": \"alternate\" } ] } ] } Body embed mode The body embed mode returns the JSON/XML body of the events into the feed as well, depending on the type of the feed. You can see this in the request below: Request Response curl -i -H \"Accept:application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream?embed=body\" HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTo, ES-ExpectedVersion Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, must-revalidate Vary: Accept ETag: \"0;248368668\" Content-Type: application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Fri, 13 Mar 2015 16:32:06 GMT Content-Length: 1608 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 { \"title\": \"Event stream 'newstream'\", \"id\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\">, \"updated\": \"2015-03-13T12:13:42.492473Z\", \"streamId\": \"newstream\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"EventStore\" }, \"headOfStream\": true, \"selfUrl\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\">, \"eTag\": \"0;248368668\", \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream\", \"relation\": \"self\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/head/backward/20\", \"relation\": \"first\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/1/forward/20\", \"relation\": \"previous\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/metadata\", \"relation\": \"metadata\" } ], \"entries\": \\[ { \"eventId\": \"fbf4a1a1-b4a3-4dfe-a01f-ec52c34e16e4\", \"eventType\": \"event-type\", \"eventNumber\": 0, \"data\": \"{\\\\n \"a\": \"1\"\\\\n}\", \"streamId\": \"newstream\", \"isJson\": true, \"isMetaData\": false, \"isLinkMetaData\": false, \"positionEventNumber\": 0, \"positionStreamId\": \"newstream\", \"title\": \"0@newstream\", \"id\": \"<http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0\">, \"updated\": \"2015-03-13T12:13:42.492473Z\", \"author\": { \"name\": \"EventStore\" }, \"summary\": \"event-type\", \"links\": [ { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0\", \"relation\": \"edit\" }, { \"uri\": \"http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/newstream/0\", \"relation\": \"alternate\" } ] } ] } Variants of body embed mode Two other modes are variants of body : PrettyBody tries to reformat the JSON to make it \"pretty to read\". TryHarder works harder to try to parse and reformat the JSON from an event to return it in the feed. These do not include further information and are focused on how the feed looks. Embedding Data into Streams in XML format The XML format embeds no additional data, as only JSON supports embedding.

    "keywords": "Events as a storage mechanism When most people consider storage for an object they tend to think about it in a structural sense. That is when considering how to store the sale discussed above they think of it as a \"Sale\" that has \"Line Items\" and perhaps \"Shipping Information\" associated with it. This is not the only way to conceptualize the problem and other solutions offer different and often interesting architectural properties. Consider the creation of a small \"Order\" object for a web-based sale system. Most developers would envision something similar to the image below. An \"Order\" has \"n Line Items\" and \"Shipping Information\". <!-- ![A simplified structural model of an order][1] --> This is not the only way to view this data. Earlier we discussed the concept of a transaction. Developers deal with the concept of transactions regularly, you can view them as representing the change between a point and the next subsequent point, and they are often referred to as “deltas”. You can define the delta between two static states, but frequently this is an implicit concept, relegated to a framework such as Hibernate in the Java world or Entity Framework in the Microsoft world. These frameworks save the original state and then calculate the differences with the new state and update the backing data model accordingly. Making these deltas explicit can be valuable for technical and business benefits. You can see the usage of deltas in many mature business models. The canonical example of delta usage is in the field of accounting. When looking at a ledger such as below, each transaction or delta is recorded. Next to it is a denormalized total of the state of the account at the end of that delta. To calculate this value, the current delta is applied to the last known value. The last known value can be trusted because at any given point you could re-run the transactions from the \"beginning of time\" for that account to reconcile the validity of that value. A verifiable audit log always exists. Date Comment Change Current Balance 1/Jan/2000 Deposit from 1372 +10,000.00 10,000.00 3/Jan/2000 Check 1 -4,000.00 6,000.00 4/Jan/2000 Purchase Coffee -3.00 5,997.00 4/Jan/2000 Purchase Internet -5.00 5,992.00 8/Jan/2000 Deposit from 1373 +1,000.00 6,992.00 Because the transactions or deltas associated with the account exist, you can step through them, verifying the result at each stage. You can derive the “Current Balance” at any point by looking at the “Current Balance” or by adding up all the “Changes” since the beginning of time for the account. The second property is valuable in a domain such as accounting as accountants are dealing with money and the ability to check that calculations were performed correctly is invaluable. It was more valuable before computers when it was common place to have an exhausted accountant make a mistake in a calculation at 3am when they should be sleeping. There are other interesting properties to this mechanism of representing state. As an example, it's possible to go back and look at what a state was at a given. Consider for example, that the account has reached a balance below zero and there is a rule that says it's not supposed to. It is relatively easy to view the state the account was in prior to processing the transaction that put it into the invalid state. This makes it far easier to reproduce what often end up as heisenbugs in other circumstances. These types of benefits are not only limited to naturally transaction based domains. Every domain is a naturally transaction-based domain when Domain Driven Design is applied. When applying Domain Driven Design there is a heavy focus on behaviours normally coinciding with use cases, Domain Driven Design is interested in how users use the system. Returning to the order example from earlier, you could represent the same order in the form of a transactional model as below: <!-- ![Transactional view of an order][2] --> You can apply this to any type of object. By replaying through the events, you can return the object to the last known state. It is mathematically equivalent to storing the end of the equation or the equation that represents it. There is a structural representation of the object but it exists only by replaying previous transactions to return the structure to its last known state. Data is not persisted in a structure but as a series of transactions. One interesting possibility is that unlike when storing current state in a structural way, there is no coupling between the representation of current state in the domain and in storage. The representation of current state in the domain can vary without thought of the persistence mechanism. It is important to note the language in Figure 3. All of the verbs are in the past tense. These are Domain Events. Consider what would happen if the language were in the imperative tense, \"Add 2 socks item 137\", \"Create Cart\". What if there were behaviours associated with adding an item, such as reserving it from an inventory system via a webservice call? Should you include these behaviours when reconstituting an object? What if logic has changed so that this item could no longer be added given the context? This is one of many examples where dual contexts between commands and events are required, there is a contextual difference between returning to a given state and attempting to transition to a new one. There is no Delete A common question that arises is how to delete information. It is not possible, as previously, to jump into the time machine and say that an event never happened (e.g. delete a previous event). As such, it is necessary to model a delete explicitly as a new transaction as shown below. Further discussion on the business value of handling deletes in this mechanism can be found in \" Business Value of the Event Log \". <!-- ![Transactional view of an order with delete][3] --> In the event stream above, the two pairs of socks were added then later removed. The end state is equivalent to not having added the two pairs of socks. However, the data was not deleted, new data was added to bring the object to the state as if the first event had not happened, this process is known as a \"Reversal Transaction\". By placing a reversal transaction in the event stream, not only is the object returned to the state as if the item had not been added, the reversal leaves a trail that shows that the object had been in that state at a given point in time."

For developers in functional languages such as Scala or Haskell this should feel natural to you, for C# developers it should feel familiar, and for Java developers I hear that Scala is a nice language. All kidding aside… When we “replay” an event stream we are returning a series of events. An event is essentially a serialized method call. We left fold something that redefines what those methods mean to us today in order to get our current state. This can be seen explicitly when looking at how the projections work in JavaScript. We define a function as: when([SomePatternMatch], function(state, event) { return new state; }); These functions are then chained over the event stream resulting at the end with a state object. The state is passed from one function to the next allowing each function to transform it. Said differently, Current State is a [left fold][6] of previous facts. We can further continue this to say that a snapshot is nothing but a memoization of the left fold. When looked at from this perspective one could state that an Event Store is actually a functional database."

    "keywords": "Business Value of the Event Log Note The value of an event log is directly correlated with use cases that you would want to use Domain Driven Design in the first place. You should use Domain Driven Design in cases where the business derives competitive advantage. Domain Driven Design itself is difficult and expensive to apply, but a company will receive high ROI on the effort if the domain is complex and if they derive competitive advantage from it. Using an Event Log similarly will have high ROI when dealing with an area of competitive advantage but may have negative ROI in other places. Storing only current state limits organizations to asking certain kinds of questions about the data. For example consider orders in the stock market. They can change for a few reasons. An order can change the volume to buy/sell, the trading system can automatically adjust the volume of an order, or a trade could occur lowering the volume available on the current order. If posed with a question regarding current liquidity, such as the price for a given number of shares in the market, it does not matter which of these changes occurred. It does not matter how the data got the way it was. It matters what it is at a given point in time. A vast majority of queries even in the business world are focused on the what labels to send customers mails, how much was sold in April, how many widgets are in the warehouse. There are however other types of queries that are becoming more and more popular in business. They focus on the how. Examples can commonly be seen in the buzzword “Business Intelligence”. Perhaps there is a correlation between people having done an action and their likelihood of purchasing some product? These types of questions generally focus on how something came into being as opposed to what it came out to be. It is best to go through an example. There is a development team at a large online retailer. In an iteration planning meeting a domain expert comes up with an idea. He believes that there is a correlation between people having added then removed an item from their cart and their likelihood of responding to suggestions of that product by purchasing it at a later point. The feature is added to the following iteration. The first hypothetical team is utilizing a stereotypical current state based mechanism for storing state. They plan that in this iteration they will add tracking of items via a fact table that are removed from carts. They plan for the next iteration that they will then build a report. The business will receive after the second iteration a report that can show them information back to the previous iteration when the team released the functionality that began tracking items being removed from carts. This is a very stereotypical process. At some organizations the report and the tracking may be released simultaneously but this is a relatively small detail in the handling. From a business perspective the domain experts are happy. They made a request of the team and the team was able to quickly fulfill the request. New functionality has been added in a quick and relatively painless way. The second team will however have quite a different result. The second team has been storing events; they represent their current state by building up off of a series of events. They just like the first team go through and add tracking of items removed from carts via a fact table but they also run this handler from the beginning of the event log to back populate all of the data from the time that the business started. They release the report in the same iteration and the report has data that dates back for years. The second team can do this because they have managed to store what the system actually did as opposed to what the current state of data is. It is possible to go back and look and interpret the old data in new and interesting ways. It was never considered to track what items were removed from carts or perhaps the number of times a user removes and items from their cart was considered important. These are both examples of new and interesting ways of looking at data. As the events represent every action the system has undertaken any possible model describing the system can be built from the events. Businesses regularly come up with new and interesting ways of looking at data. It is not possible with any level of confidence to predict how a business will want to look at today’s data in five years. The ability for the business to look at the data in the way that it wants in five years is of an unknown but possibly extremely high value; it has already been stated that this should be done in areas where the business derives its competitive advantage so it is relatively easy to reason that the ability to look at today’s data in an unexpected way could be a competitive advantage for the business. How do you value the possible success or failure of a company based upon an architectural decision now? How do software teams justify looking at their Magic 8 Ball to predict what the business will need in five or even ten years? Many try to use YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It) but YAGNI only applies when you actually know that you won’t need it. How can the dynamic world of business and how they may want to look at data in five or ten years be predicted? Is it more expensive to actually model every behavior in the system? Yes. Is it more expensive in terms of disk cost and thought process to store every event in the system? Yes. Are these costs worth the ROI when the business derives a competitive advantage from the data?"

You can make an optimistic concurrency check during the write by specifying the version at which you expect the stream to be.

The members on EventData are: Member Description Guid EventId A unique identifier representing this event. Event Store uses this for idempotency if you write the same event twice you should use the same identifier both times. string Type The name of the event type. You can use this for pattern matching in projections, so should be a \"friendly\" name rather than a CLR type name, for example. bool IsJson If the data and metadata fields are serialized as JSON, you should set this to true . Setting this to true will cause the projections framework to attempt to deserialize the data and metadata later. byte[] Data The serialized data representing the event to be stored. byte[] Metadata The serialized data representing metadata about the event to be stored. Append to a stream in a single write The AppendToStreamAsync method writes events atomically to the end of a stream, working in an asynchronous manner.

This should either be a positive integer, or one of the constants ExpectedVersion.NoStream , ExpectedVersion.EmptyStream , or to disable the check, ExpectedVersion.Any .

    "keywords": "Optimistic Concurrency & Idempotence Writing supports an optimistic concurrency check on the version of the stream to which events are written. The method of specifying what the expected version is depends whether you are making writes using the HTTP or .NET API. The .NET API has constants which you can use to represent certain conditions: Parameter Description ExpectedVersion.Any Disables the optimistic concurrency check. ExpectedVersion.NoStream Specifies the expectation that target stream does not yet exist. ExpectedVersion.EmptyStream Specifies the expectation that the target stream has been explicitly created, but does not yet have any user events written in it. ExpectedVersion.StreamExists Specifies the expectation that the target stream or its metadata stream has been created, but does not expect the stream to be at a specific event number. Any other integer value The event number that you expect the stream to currently be at. If the optimistic concurrency check fails during writing, a WrongExpectedVersionException is thrown. Idempotence If identical write operations occur, Event Store treats them in a way which makes it idempotent. If a write is treated in this manner, Event Store acknowledges it as successful, but duplicate events are not written. The idempotence check is based on the EventId and stream . It is possible to reuse an EventId across streams whilst maintaining idempotence. The level of idempotence guarantee depends on whether the optimistic concurrency check is not disabled during writing (by passing ExpectedVersion.Any as the expectedVersion for the write). If you specify an expected version The specified expectedVersion is compared to the currentVersion of the stream. This will yield one of three results: expectedVersion > currentVersion - a WrongExpectedVersionException is thrown. expectedVersion == currentVersion - events are written and acknowledged. expectedVersion < currentVersion - the EventId of each event in the stream starting from expectedVersion are compared to those in the write operation. This can yield one of three further results: All events have been committed already - the write is acknowledged as successful, but no duplicate events written. None of the events were previously committed - a WrongExpectedVersionException is thrown. Some of the events were previously committed - this is considered a bad request. If the write contains the same events as a previous request, either all or none of the events should have been previously committed. This surfaces as a WrongExpectedVersionException . If you specify ExpectedVersion.Any Note Idempotence is not guaranteed if you use ExpectedVersion.Any . The chance of a duplicate event is small, but is possible. The idempotence check will yield one of three results: All events have been committed already - the write is acknowledged as successful, but no duplicate events written. None of the events were previously committed - the events are written and the write acknowledged. Some of the events were previously committed - this is considered a bad request.

You can configure your node through methods provided by the EmbeddedVNodeBuilder class. Note The builder used for the EmbeddedVNodeBuilder is the same Event Store uses internally to create the ClusterNode , see EventStore.ClusterNode.Program.cs for more examples on how to use it. Building a node You have two options when you start creating a node, EmbeddedVNodeBuilder.AsSingleNode() or EmbeddedVNodeBuilder.AsClusterMember(clusterSize) , which will create a single node or a cluster node respectively. After creating the builder, you can configure the node through the methods provided by the EmbeddedVNodeBuilder . These are listed below. Once you have configured the node, build it with EmbeddedVNodeBuilder.Build() which returns the configured ClusterVNode . Start the node with ClusterVNode.StartAndWaitUntilReady() or ClusterVNode.Start() . ClusterVNode.StartAndWaitUntilReady() returns a task that completes once the node has started and all subsystems have finished loading. For example, to build a single node with default options : var nodeBuilder = EmbeddedVNodeBuilder.AsSingleNode() .OnDefaultEndpoints() .RunInMemory(); var node = nodeBuilder.Build(); node.StartAndWaitUntilReady().Wait(); To build a node to be part of a cluster with custom endpoints and gossip seeds: var nodeBuilder = EmbeddedVNodeBuilder.AsClusterMember(3) .RunOnDisk(\"node1db\") .WithInternalHttpOn(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1112)) .WithExternalHttpOn(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1113)) .WithExternalTcpOn(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1114)) .WithInternalTcpOn(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 1115)) .DisableDnsDiscovery() .WithGossipSeeds(new IPEndPoint[] { new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 2112), new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Loopback, 3112) }); var node = nodeBuilder.Build(); node.Start(); Warning When running an embedded cluster, the task returned by StartAndWaitUntilReady() only completes on the master node. Connecting to an embedded node You can connect to an embedded Event Store node with the EmbeddedEventStoreConnection class. Calling EmbeddedEventStoreConnection.Create(ClusterVNode) returns an IEventStoreConnection configured to connect to your embedded node.

Prerequisites Install the following utilities in your development machine. Kubectl Helm Google Cloud SDK Configuration steps Login in your Google Cloud account using the gcloud cli, this prompts you to login using any browser and copy/paste a key back in to the cli: gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser Set the region , and the project id from above: gcloud config set compute/region <regionname> gcloud config set project <projectid> Enable the Kubernetes Engine API for your project, by visiting the https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/container.googleapis.com?project={project-id} page. Create a Kubernetes Cluster in your account, the following command does not specify the number of nodes and uses the default of 3:. gcloud container clusters create <clustername> --zone <zonename> We recommend kubectl for managing resources in the Kubernetes cluster. Set the current context for kubectl and merge it with any existing configuration in your existing config file: gcloud beta container clusters get-credentials <clustername> --zone <zonename> --project <projectid> On the server side Helm relies on a service account called Tiller, and you need to configure this account for Role Base Access as Google Cloud GKE enables it by default. To configure RBAC follow these instructions . In Summary you need to create a special deployment with the Tiller user settings before running the helm init command. You can then check if the 'tiller-deploy-xxxx' pod is running kubectl -n kube-system get pod Deploy Event Store Cluster with Helm It is possible to specify a lot of options to customise your Event Store deployment. The setting used in this guide is \"Persistent Volume\", that allows you to deploy a Persistent Volume Claim . This Claim is an abstraction that requires Kubernetes to set up one persistent volume per each Event Store node and assign an id to it. These volumes are then reused by the cluster, for example, we want to upgrade the version of the Cluster and retain the data. If we don’t specify an existing volume then the volumes are dynamically created. helm repo add eventstore <https://eventstore.github.io/EventStore.Charts> helm repo update helm install -n eventstore eventstore/eventstore --set persistence.enabled=true Google Cloud GKE sets the authentication to use RBAC by default. Because of this, to reach your Event Store cluster you have to set up access for anonymous users. This is something you would only do for a test environment using the following command: kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-system-anonymous --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=system:anonymous Upgrade the cluster with a newer version Verify your current Event Store cluster: helm status eventstore Fork the official Helm Chart Event Store repository and change the version of the image in the chart values.yaml . And run the command in the same directory as the chart: helm upgrade eventstore . --set persistence.enabled=true The upgrade command upgrades all the pods one by one without downtime and attaches the existing volumes to the new pods during the upgrade.

    "keywords": "Overview Event Store provides a native interface of AtomPub over HTTP. AtomPub is a RESTful protocol that can reuse many existing components, for example reverse proxies and a client's native HTTP caching. Since events stored in Event Store are immutable, cache expiration can be infinite. Event Store leverages content type negotiation and you can access appropriately serialised events can as JSON or XML according to the request headers. Compatibility with AtomPub Event Store is fully compatible with the 1.0 version of the Atom Protocol . Event Store adds extensions to the protocol, such as headers for control and custom rel links. Existing Implementations Many environments have already implemented the AtomPub protocol, which simplifies the process. Library Description NET (BCL) System.ServiceModel.SyndicationServices JVM http://java-source.net/open-source/rss-rdf-tools PHP http://simplepie.org/ or https://github.com/fguillot/picoFeed Ruby https://github.com/cardmagic/simple-rss Clojure https://github.com/scsibug/feedparser-clj Go https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-pkg-rss Python http://code.google.com/p/feedparser/ node.js https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser Objective-C https://geekli.st/darvin/repos/MWFeedParser Note These are not officially supported by Event Store. Content Types The preferred way of determining which content type responses Event Store serves is to set the Accept header on the request. As some clients do not deal well with HTTP headers when caching, appending a format parameter to the URL is also supported, e.g., ?format=xml . The accepted content types for POST requests are: application/xml application/vnd.eventstore.events+xml application/json application/vnd.eventstore.events+json text/xml The accepted content types for GET requests are: application/xml application/atom+xml application/json application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json text/xml text/html application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json"

    "keywords": "Description Document <!-- TODO: Combine with CC pages? --> With the addition of Competing Consumers, which is another way of reading streams, the need arose to expose these different methods to consumers. The introduction of the description document has some benefits: Clients can rely on the keys (streams, streamSubscription) in the description document to remain unchanged across versions of Event Store and you can rely on it as a lookup for the particular method of reading a stream. Allows the restructuring of URIs underneath without breaking clients. e.g., /streams/newstream -> /streams/newstream/atom . Fetching the description document There are 3 ways in which Event Store returns the description document. Attempting to read a stream with an unsupported media type. Attempting to read a stream with no accept header. Requesting the description document explicitly. The client is able to request the description document by passing application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json in the accept header, for example: Request Response curl -i http://localhost:2113/streams/newstream -H \"accept:application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json\" HTTP/1.1 200 Description Document Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Prefix, X-PINGOTHER, Authorization, ES-LongPoll, ES-ExpectedVersion, ES-EventId, ES-EventType, ES-RequiresMaster, ES-HardDelete, ES-ResolveLinkTos Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Location, ES-Position, ES-CurrentVersion Content-Type: application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json; charset=utf-8 Server: Mono-HTTPAPI/1.0 Date: Thu, 23 Aug 2018 12:37:18 GMT Content-Length: 517 Keep-Alive: timeout=15,max=100 { \"title\": \"Description document for 'newstream'\", \"description\": \"The description document will be presented when no accept header is present or it was requested\", \"_links\": { \"self\": { \"href\": \"/streams/newstream\", \"supportedContentTypes\": [ \"application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json\" ] }, \"stream\": { \"href\": \"/streams/newstream\", \"supportedContentTypes\": [ \"application/atom+xml\", \"application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json\" ] } } } In the example above, the client requested the description document for the stream called newstream which has a set of links describing the supported methods and content types. The document also includes additional methods available such as the streamSubscription . If there are no subscriptions to the newstream , the streamSubscription key is absent."

    "title": "Rolling Snapshots | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Rolling Snapshots A rolling snapshot is a projection of the current state of an aggregate at a given point. It represents the state when all events to that point have been replayed. You use rolling snapshots as a heuristic to prevent the need to load all events for the entire history of an aggregate. One way of processing events in the event stream is to replay the events from the beginning of time until the end of the event stream. The problem is that there may be a large number of events between the beginning of time and the current point. You can imagine that an event stream with a million or more events would be inefficient to load. The solution is to use a rolling snapshot to place a denormalization of the state at a given point. It is then be possible to play the events from that point forward to load the aggregate. The process for rebuilding an aggregate changes when using rolling snapshots. Instead of reading forward from the beginning of time it is read backwards, putting the events on to a stack until there are no more events left or a snapshot is found. The snapshot is then applied and the events would popped off the stack and applied until the stack was empty. Note Although this is an easy way to conceptualize how rolling snapshots work, this is a less than ideal solution in a production system for various reasons. It is better to store them seperately events. The snapshot itself is nothing more than a serialized form of the graph at that given point. By having the state of that graph at that point replaying all the events prior to that snapshot can be avoided. Snapshots can be taken asynchronously by a process monitoring the Event Store. Introducing Rolling Snapshots allows control of the worst case when loading from events. The maximum number of events that would be processed can be tuned to optimize performance for the system in question. With the introduction of Rolling Snapshots it is a relatively trivial process to achieve one to two orders of magnitude of performance gain on the two operations that the Event Storage supports. It is important though to remember that Rolling Snapshots are just a heuristic and that conceptually the event stream is still viewed in its entirety."

    "title": "Performance and Scalability | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Performance and Scalability There are also architectural benefits to not deleting data. The storage system becomes an append-only architecture. Append-only architectures typically distribute and scale more easily than updating architectures because there are fewer locks to deal with. A common performance optimization is the use of \"horizontal partitioning\" (or \"sharding\"), where the same schema will exist in many places and a key within the data will determine in which place the data exists. One problem with horizontal partitioning with an RDMS is that it is necessary to define the key with which the partitioning should operate. This problem goes away when using events. Aggregate IDs are the only partition point in the system. No matter how many aggregates exist or how they may change structures, the aggregate ID associated with events is the only partition point in the system. Horizontally partitioning an Event Store is a simpler process. Saving Objects When dealing with a stereotypical system utilizing an RDMS it can be complex to figure out what has changed within the aggregate. Many tools have been built to help alleviate the pain that arises from this task but is the need for a tool a sign of a bigger problem? Most Object-relational mapping (ORM) tools figure out the changes that occurred within a graph. They do this by maintaining two copies of a given graph. The first held in memory and the second for applications to interact with. When it's time to save, the database logic traverses the graph that the code has interacted with and uses the copy of the original graph to determine what has changed while the graph was in use by the code. These changes are then saved to the data storage system. In a system that is Domain Event centric, the aggregates are themselves tracking strong events as to what has changed within them. There is no complex process for comparing to another copy of a graph. Instead ask the aggregate for its changes. The operation to ask for changes is far more efficient than having to figure out what has changed. Loading Objects A similar issue exists when loading objects. Consider the work that involved with loading a graph of objects in a stereotypical relational database backed system. Often there are many queries that must be issued to build the aggregate. To help minimize the latency cost of these queries many ORMs have introduced a heuristic of \"Lazy Loading\" also known as \"Delayed Loading\", where a proxy is given in lieu of the real object. The data is only loaded when some code attempts to use that particular object. Lazy loading is useful because often a given behavior will only use a certain portion of data out of the aggregate and it prevents the developer from having to explicitly represent which data that is while reducing the cost of the loading of the aggregate. It is this need for reducing cost that shows a problem. Aggregates are considered as a whole represented by the Aggregate Root. Conceptually an Aggregate is loaded and saved in its entirety. Evans, 2001 Conceptually it is much easier to deal with the concept of an aggregate loaded and saved in its entirety. The concept of lazy loading is not a trivial one and especially when optimizing use cases. The heuristic is needed because loading full aggregates from a relational database is operationally too slow. When dealing with events as a storage mechanism things are different. There is one thing stored, events. Load all the events for an aggregate and replay them. There can only ever be a single query on the system. There is no need to attempt to implement things like lazy loading."

    "title": "Event Sourcing Basics | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Event Sourcing Basics What is an Event Store? Event Store is a database that supports the concept of Event Sourcing, which is an old idea that has recently become popular again Note If you are familiar with functional programming you may wish to jump to the Event Store viewed as a functional database section . Production systems often rely on storing their current state to process transactions, but this has not always been the case. Before the general acceptance of relational database management systems (RDBMS) as the center of system architectures many did not store the current state. This was especially true in high performance, mission critical, and highly secure systems. If you look at the inner workings of an RDBMS you will find that most do not themselves work by managing current state. What is an Event? An event is something that happened in the past, and so you should represent events as verbs in the past tense such as CustomerRelocated , CargoShipped , or InventoryLossageRecorded . If you are taking a domain driven design approach, it's imperative that events are verbs in the past tense, as they are part of the Ubiquitous Language. Consider the differences with ubiquitous language when relocating a customer. An event makes the concept explicit where previously the changes would occur within an aggregate or between multiple aggregates and were left as an implicit concept that you needed to explore and define. In most applications, a developer discovers that a side effect occurred with a tool such as Hibernate or Entity Framework. If there is a change to the side effects of a use case, it is an implicit concept. The introduction of the event makes the concept explicit and part of the Ubiquitous Language. Relocating a customer does not change something, relocating a customer produces a CustomerRelocatedEvent event which is explicitly defined within the language. In code an event is a data holding structure such as the following: public class InventoryItemDeactivated { public readonly Guid InventoryItemId; public readonly string Reason; public InventoryItemDeactivated(inventoryItemId, reason) { InventoryItemId = inventoryItemId; Reason = reason; } } Other Definitions of Domain Events There is a concept related to a Domain Event defined in Streamlined Object Modeling (SOM). The term “Domain Event” is often used in SOM when discussing “The Event Principle”. Model the event of people interacting at a place with a thing with a transaction object. Model a point-in-time interaction as a transaction with a single timestamp; model a time-interval interaction as a transaction with multiple timestamps. Jill Nicola, 2002ll, p. 23 Although people use the term Domain Event to describe this concept the term does not have the same definition as a Domain Event in the context of this document. SOM uses another term for the concept that better describes what the object is, a transaction. The concept of a transaction object is an important one in a domain and deserves a name. An example of such a transaction might be a player swinging a bat. This is an action that occurred at a given point and you should model as such in the domain, but this is not the same as a Domain Event. This also differs from Martin Fowler’s example of what a Domain Event is: Example: I go to Babur’s for a meal on Tuesday, and pay by credit card. This might be modeled as an event, whose type is “Make Purchase”, whose subject is my credit card, and whose occurred date is Tuesday. If Babur’s uses an old manual system and doesn’t transmit the transaction until Friday, then the noticed date would be Friday. Fowler Furthermore By funneling inputs of a system into streams of Domain Events you can keep a record of all the inputs to a system. This helps you to organize your processing logic, and also allows you to keep an audit log of the system. Fowler What Martin is actually describing here is a \"command\". The language “Make Purchase” is wrong if we are to consider this as an event. A purchase was made, therefore it makes more sense to introduce a PurchaseMade event. Martin did make a purchase at the location, they did charge his credit card, and he ate and enjoyed his food. All these events are in the past tense. They have already happened and cannot be undone. An example such as the sales example given tends to lead towards a secondary problem when built within a system. The problem is that the domain may be responsible for filling in parts of the event. Consider a system where the domain processes the sale itself. How much is the sales tax? Often the domain would calculate this. This leads to a dual definition of the event. There is the event as sent from the client without the sales tax, and then the domain would receive it and add in the sales tax. It causes the event to have multiple definitions, as well as forcing mutability on some attributes. Dual events can sidestep this issue (one for the client with just what it provides and another for the domain including what it enriched the event from the client with) but this is the command event model, and the linguistic problems still exist. You can see a further example of the linguistic problems involved in error conditions. How should the domain handle the fact that a client told it to do something that it cannot? This condition can exist for many reasons but let’s imagine a simple one of the client not having enough information to source the event in a known correct way. Linguistically the command/event separation makes more sense here as the command arrives in the imperative “Place Sale” while the event is in the past tense “Sale Completed”. It's natural for the domain to reject a client attempting to “Place a sale”, it's not natural for the domain to tell the client that something in the past tense no longer happened. Consider the discussion with a domain expert. Does the domain have a time machine? Parallel realities are far too complex and costly to model in most business systems. These are the problems that led to the separation of the concepts of Commands and Events. This separation makes the language much clearer and although subtle, it tends to lead developers towards a clearer understanding of context based solely on the language used. Dual definitions of a concept force the developer to recognize and distinguish context. This weight can translate into both ramp up time for new developers on a project and another thing a member of the team needs to remember. Anytime a team member needs to remember something to distinguish context there is a higher probability that they will overlook it or mistaken for another context. Being explicit in the language and avoiding dual definitions helps make things clearer both for domain experts, the developers, and anyone who may be consuming the API.

    "keywords": "Impedance Mismatch Using events as a storage mechanism offers different properties when compared to a typical relational model, as the impedance mismatch that exists between a typical relational model and the object oriented domain model is analyzed. Scott Ambler describes the problem in an essay on agiledata.org as: Why does this impedance mismatch exist? The object-oriented paradigm is based on proven software engineering principles. The relational paradigm, however, is based on proven mathematical principles. Because the underlying paradigms are different the two technologies do not work together seamlessly. The impedance mismatch becomes apparent when you look at the preferred approach to access: With the object paradigm you traverse objects via their relationships whereas with the relational paradigm you join the data rows of tables. This fundamental difference results in a non-ideal combination of object and relational technologies, although when have you ever used two different things together without a few hitches? Ambler The impedance mismatch between the domain model and the relational database has a large cost associated with it. There are many tools that aim to help minimize the effects of the impedance mismatch such as Object Relational Mappers (ORMs). They tend to work well in most situations but there is a large cost associated to the impedance mismatch even when using tools such as ORMs. The cost is that a developer needs to be intimately familiar with both the relational model and the object oriented model. They also need to be familiar with the subtle differences between the two models. Scott identifies this with: To succeed using objects and relational databases together you need to understand both paradigms, and their differences, and then make intelligent tradeoffs based on that knowledge. Ambler You can find some of these subtle differences on Wikipedia under the \" Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch \" page but to include some of the major differences: Declarative vs. imperative interfaces Relational thinking tends to use data as interfaces, not behaviour as interfaces. It thus has a declarative tilt in design philosophy in contrast to Object-oriented programming’s behavioural tilt. (Some relational proponents propose using triggers, stored procedures, etc. to provide complex behaviour, but this is not a common viewpoint.) Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch Structure vs. behaviour - Object-oriented programming primarily focuses on ensuring that the structure of the program is reasonable (maintainable, understandable, extensible, reusable, safe), whereas relational systems focus on what kind of behaviour the resulting run-time system has (efficiency, adaptability, fault-tolerance, liveness, logical integrity, etc.). Object-oriented methods generally assume that the primary user of the object-oriented code and its interfaces are the application developers. In relational systems, the end-user’s view of the behaviour of the system is sometimes considered to be more important. However, relational queries and \"views\" are common techniques to re-represent information in application- or task-specific configurations. Further, relational does not prohibit local or application-specific structures or tables from being created, although many common development tools do not directly provide such a feature, assuming objects will be used instead. This makes it difficult to know whether the stated non-developer perspective of relational is inherent to relational, or merely a product of current practice and tObject-oriented programmingl implementation assumptions. Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch Set vs. graph relationships The relationship between different items (objects or records) tend to be handled differently between the paradigms. Relational relationships are usually based on idioms taken from set theory, while object relationships lean toward idioms adopted from graph theory (including trees). While each can represent the same information as the other, the approaches they provide to access and manage information differ. Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch There are many other subtle differences such as data types, identity, and how transactions work. The object-relational impedance mismatch can be quite a pain to deal with and it requires a very large amount of knowledge to deal with effectively. There is not an impedance mismatch between events and the domain model. The events are themselves a domain concept. The idea of replaying events to reach a given state is also a domain concept. The entire system becomes defined in domain terms. Defining everything in domain terms not only lowers the amount of knowledge that developers need to have but it also limits the number of representations of the model needed as the events are directly tied to the domain model itself."

Internally, the metadata includes information such as the ACL of the stream and the maximum count and age for the events in the stream. Client code can also put information into stream metadata for use with projections or through the client API. A common use of this information is to store associated details about an event that is not part of the event. Examples of these are: \"which user wrote the event?\" \"Which application server were they talking to?\" \"From what IP address did the request come from?\" This information is not part of the actual event but is metadata associated with the event.

You can use the GetStreamMetadata methods in two ways. The first is to return a fluent interface over the stream metadata, and the second is to return you the raw JSON of the stream metadata. Task<StreamMetadataResult> GetStreamMetadataAsync(string stream, UserCredentials userCredentials = null) This returns a StreamMetadataResult . The fields on this result are: Member Description string Stream The name of the stream bool IsStreamDeleted true is the stream is deleted, false otherwise. long MetastreamVersion The version of the metastream format StreamMetadata Metadata A StreamMetadata object representing the metadata JSON You can then access the StreamMetadata via the StreamMetadata object. It contains typed fields for well known stream metadata entries. Member Description long? MaxAge The maximum age of events in the stream. Items older than this will be automatically removed. long? MaxCount The maximum count of events in the stream. When you have more than count the oldest will be removed. long? TruncateBefore When set says that items prior to event 'E' can be truncated and will be removed. TimeSpan? CacheControl The head of a feed in the atom api is not cacheable. This allows you to specify a period of time you want it to be cacheable. Low numbers are best here (say 30-60 seconds) and introducing values here will introduce latency over the atom protocol if caching is occuring. StreamAcl Acl The access control list for this stream. If instead you want to work with raw JSON you can use the raw methods for stream metadata.

The fields on this result are: Member Description string Stream The name of the stream bool IsStreamDeleted True is the stream is deleted, false otherwise. long MetastreamVersion The version of the metastream (see Expected Version ) byte[] Metadata The raw data of the metadata JSON Note If you enabled enabled security , reading metadata may require that you pass credentials. By default it is only allowed for admins though you can change this via default ACLs. If you do not pass credentials and they are required you will receive an AccessedDeniedException . Writing Metadata You can write metadata in both a typed and a raw mechanism. When writing it is generally easier to use the typed mechanism. Both writing mechanisms support an expectedVersion which works the same as on any stream and you can use to control concurrency, read Expected Version for further details. Task<WriteResult> SetStreamMetadataAsync(string stream, long expectedMetastreamVersion, StreamMetadata metadata, UserCredentials userCredentials = null) The StreamMetadata passed above has a builder that you can access via the StreamMetadata.Create() method.

OriginalPosition The logical position of the OriginalEvent string OriginalStreamId The stream name of the OriginalEvent long OriginalEventNumber The event number in the stream of the OriginalEvent Note To ensure that the Event Store server follows link events when reading, ensure you set the ResolveLinkTos parameter to true when calling read methods. RecordedEvent RecordedEvent contains all the data about a specific event. Instances of this class are immutable, and expose the following members: Member Description string EventStreamId The Event Stream this event belongs to Guid EventId The Unique Identifier representing this event long EventNumber The number of this event in the stream string EventType The event type (supplied when writing) byte[] Data A byte array representing the data of this event byte[] Metadata A byte array representing the metadata associated with this event bool IsJson Indicates whether the content was internally marked as json DateTime Created A datetime representing when this event was created. long CreatedEpoch A long representing the milliseconds since the epoch when the was created. Read a single event The ReadEventAsync method reads a single event from a stream at a specified position. This is the simplest case of reading events, but is still useful for situations such as reading the last event in the stream used as a starting point for a subscription. This function accepts three parameters: Parameter Description string stream The stream to read from long eventNumber The event number to read (use StreamPosition.End to read the last event in the stream) bool resolveLinkTos Determines whether any link events encountered in the stream will be resolved. See the discussion on Resolved Events for more information on this This method returns an instance of EventReadResult which indicates if the read was successful, and if so the ResolvedEvent that was read. Reading a stream forwards The ReadStreamEventsForwardAsync method reads the requested number of events in the order in which they were originally written to the stream from a nominated starting point in the stream. The parameters are: Parameter Description string Stream The name of the stream to read long start The earliest event to read (inclusive). For the special case of the start of the stream, you should use the constant StreamPosition.Start . int count The maximum number of events to read in this request (assuming that many exist between the start specified and the end of the stream) bool resolveLinkTos Determines whether any link events encountered in the stream will be resolved. See the discussion on Resolved Events for more information on this Example: Read an entire stream forwards from start to end This example uses the ReadStreamEventsForwardAsync method in a loop to page through all events in a stream, reading 200 events at a time to build a list of all the events in the stream. var streamEvents = new List<ResolvedEvent>(); StreamEventsSlice currentSlice; var nextSliceStart = StreamPosition.Start; do { currentSlice = _eventStoreConnection.ReadStreamEventsForward(\"myStream\", nextSliceStart, 200, false) .Result; nextSliceStart = currentSlice.NextEventNumber; streamEvents.AddRange(currentSlice.Events); } while (!currentSlice.IsEndOfStream); Note It's unlikely that client code would need to build a list in this manner. It's far more likely that you would pass events into a left fold to derive the state of some object as of a given event. Read a stream backwards The ReadStreamEventsBackwardAsync method reads the requested number of events in the reverse order from that in which they were originally written to the stream from a specified starting point. The parameters are: Parameter Description string Stream The name of the stream to read long start The latest event to read (inclusive). For the end of the stream use the constant StreamPosition.End int count The maximum number of events to read in this request (assuming that many exist between the start specified and the start of the stream) bool resolveLinkTos Determines whether any link events encountered in the stream will be resolved. See the discussion on Resolved Events for more information on this Read all events Event Store allows you to read events across all streams using the ReadAllEventsForwardAsync and ReadAllEventsBackwardsAsync methods. These work in the same way as the regular read methods, but use an instance of the global log file Position to reference events rather than the simple integer stream position described previously. They also return an AllEventsSlice rather than a StreamEventsSlice which is the same except it uses global Position s rather than stream positions. Example: Read all events forward from start to end var allEvents = new List<ResolvedEvent>(); AllEventsSlice currentSlice; var nextSliceStart = Position.Start; do { currentSlice = connection.ReadAllEventsForwardAsync(nextSliceStart, 200, false).Result; nextSliceStart = currentSlice.NextPosition; allEvents.AddRange(currentSlice.Events); } while (!currentSlice.IsEndOfStream);"

    "title": "Connecting to a Server | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Connecting to a Server EventStoreConnection The EventStoreConnection class maintains a full-duplex connection between the client and the Event Store server. EventStoreConnection is thread-safe and we recommend that you create one instance per application. All operations are fully asynchronous and return either a Task or a Task<T> . If you need to execute synchronously, call .Wait() , or Result on the asynchronous version. To get maximum performance from the connection we recommend that you use it asynchronously. Note The Create methods have changed since version 3.0.2 as connection strings are now supported. The old mechanisms will still work but are marked obsolete and will be removed in the future. Creating a Connection The EventStoreConnection classes uses the static Create methods to create a new connection. All method overloads allow you to optionally specify a name for the connection, which the connection returns when it raises events (see Connection Events ). Method Description Create(Uri uri) Connects to Event Store (see URIs below) with default settings Create(ConnectionSettings connectionSettings, Uri uri) Connects to Event Store (see URIs below) with specified settings Create(string connectionString) Connects to Event Store (see URIs below) with settings from connection string (obsolete) Create(IPEndPoint tcpEndPoint) Connects to a single node with default settings (obsolete) Create(ConnectionSettings settings, IPEndPoint tcpEndPoint) Connects to a single node with custom settings (see Customising Connection Settings ) (obsolete) Create(ConnectionSettings connectionSettings, ClusterSettings clusterSettings) Connects to an Event Store HA cluster with custom settings (see Cluster Settings ) Note The connection returned by these methods is inactive. Use the ConnectAsync() method to establish a connection with the server. URIs The create methods support passing of a URI to the connection as opposed to passing IPEndPoints . This URI should be in the format of: Single Node : tcp://user:password@myserver:11234 Cluster : discover://user:password@myserver:1234 Where the port number points to the TCP port of the Event Store instance (1113 by default) or points to the manager gossip port for discovery purposes. With the URI based mechanism you can pass a domain name and the client will resolve it. Note The client performs a blocking DNS call for single node. If you are worried about blocking DNS due to network issues etc., you should resolve the DNS yourself and pass in an IP address. Customising Connection Settings Connection String Many of the overloads accept a connection string that you can use to control settings of the connection. A benefit to having these as a connection string instead of using the fluent API is that you can change them between environments without recompiling (i.e. a single node in dev and a cluster in production ). The connection string format should look familiar to those who have used connection strings in the past. It consists of a series of key/value pairs separated by semicolons. You can set the following values using the connection string. <!-- TODO: Moved, to check and what about ConnectTo? --> Name Format Description VerboseLogging True/false Enables verbose logging MaxQueueSize Integer Maximum number of outstanding operations MaxConcurrentItems Integer Maximum number of concurrent async operations MaxRetries Integer Maximum number of retry attempts MaxReconnections Integer The maximum number of times to try reconnecting RequireMaster True/false If set the server will only process if it is master ReconnectionDelay Integer (milliseconds) The delay before attempting to reconnect OperationTimeout Integer (milliseconds) The time before considering an operation timed out OperationTimeoutCheckPeriod Integer (milliseconds) The frequency in which to check timeouts DefaultUserCredentials String in format username:password The default credentials for the connection UseSslConnection True/false whether to use SSL for this connection TargetHost String The hostname expected on the certificate ValidateServer True/false Whether to validate the remote server FailOnNoServerResponse True/False Whether to fail on no server response HeartbeatInterval Integer (milliseconds) The interval at which to send the server a heartbeat HeartbeatTimeout Integer (milliseconds) The amount of time to receive a heartbeat response before timing out ClusterDns string The DNS name of the cluster for discovery MaxDiscoverAttempts Integer The maximum number of attempts to try to discover the cluster ExternalGossipPort Integer The port to try to gossip on GossipTimeout Integer (milliseconds) The amount of time before timing out a gossip response GossipSeeds Comma separated list of ip:port A list of seeds to try to discover from ConnectTo A URI in format described above to connect to The URI to connect to [!INFO] You can also use spacing instead of camel casing in your connection string. var connectionString = \"ConnectTo=tcp://admin:changeit@localhost:1113; HeartBeatTimeout=500\" Sets the connection string to connect to localhost on the default port and sets the heartbeat timeout to 500ms. var connectionString = \"Connect To = tcp://admin:changeit@localhost:1113; Gossip Timeout = 500\" Using spaces: var connectionString = \"ConnectTo=discover://admin:changeit@mycluster:3114; HeartBeatTimeout=500\" Tells the connection to try gossiping to a manager node found under the DNS 'mycluster' at port '3114' to connect to the cluster. var connectionString = \"GossipSeeds=192.168.0.2:1111,192.168.0.3:1111; HeartBeatTimeout=500\" Tells the connection to try gossiping to the gossip seeds 192.168.0.2 or 192.168.0.3 on port '1111' to discover information about the cluster. Note See the fluent API below for defaults of values. Note You can also use the ConnectionString class to return a ConnectionSettings object. Fluent API Settings used for modifying the behavior of an EventStoreConnection are encapsulated into an object of type ConnectionSettings passed as a parameter to the Create methods listed above. Instances of ConnectionSettings are created using a fluent builder class: ConnectionSettings settings = ConnectionSettings.Create(); This creates an instance of ConnectionSettings with default options. You can override these by chaining the additional builder methods described below. Logging The .NET API can log information to different destinations. By default logging is disabled. <!-- TODO: Moved, to check. Actually missing options. --> Builder Method Description UseConsoleLogger() Output log messages using Console.WriteLine UseDebugLogger() Output log messages using Debug.WriteLine UseCustomLogger() Output log messages to the specified instance of ILogger (You should implement this interface in order to log using another library such as NLog or log4net). EnableVerboseLogging() Turns on verbose logging. By default information about connection, disconnection and errors are logged, however it can be useful to have more information about specific operations as they are occuring. User Credentials Event Store supports Access Control Lists that restrict permissions for a stream based on users and groups. EventStoreConnection allows you to supply credentials for each operation, however it is often more convenient to set default credentials for all operations on the connection. Builder Method Description SetDefaultUserCredentials(UserCredentials credentials) Sets the default UserCredentials to use for this connection. If you don't supply any credentials, the operation will use these. You create a UserCredentials object as follows: UserCredentials credentials = new UserCredentials(\"username\",\"password\"); Security The .NET API and Event Store can communicate either over SSL or an unencrypted channel (by default). To configure the client-side of the SSL connection, use the builder method below. For more information on setting up the server end of the Event Store for SSL, see SSL Setup . UseSslConnection(string targetHost, bool validateServer) Uses an SSL-encrypted connection where targetHost is the name specified on the SSL certificate installed on the server, and validateServer controls whether the connection validates the server certificate. Warning In production systems where credentials are sent from the client to Event Store, you should always use SSL encryption and you should set validateServer to true . Node Preference When connecting to an Event Store HA cluster you can specify that operations are performed on any node, or only on the node that is the master. Builder Method Description PerformOnMasterOnly() Require the master to serve all write and read requests (Default). PerformOnAnyNode() Allow for writes to be forwarded and read requests to be served locally if the current node is not master. Handling Failures The following methods on the ConnectionSettingsBuilder allow you to change the way the connection handles operation failures and connection issues. Reconnections Builder Method Description WithConnectionTimeoutOf (TimeSpan timeout) Sets the timeout to connect to a server before aborting and attempting a reconnect (Default: 1 second). LimitReconnectionsTo (int limit) Limits the number of reconnections this connection can try to make (Default: 10). KeepReconnecting() Allows infinite reconnection attempts. SetReconnectionDelayTo (TimeSpan reconnectionDelay) Sets the delay between reconnection attempts (Default: 100ms). SetHeartbeatInterval (TimeSpan interval) Sets how often the connection should expect heartbeats (lower values detect broken sockets faster) (Default: 750ms). SetHeartbeatTimeout (TimeSpan timeout) Sets how long to wait without heartbeats before determining a connection to be dead (must be longer than the heatrbeat interval) (Default: 1500ms). Operations Builder Method Description SetOperationTimeout (TimeSpan timeout) Sets the operation timeout duration (Default: 7 seconds). SetTimeoutCheckPeriodTo (TimeSpan timeoutCheckPeriod) Sets how often to check for timeouts (Default: 1 second). LimitAttemptsForOperationTo (int limit) Limits the number of operation attempts (Default: 11). LimitRetriesForOperationTo (int limit) Limits the number of operation retries (Default: 10). KeepRetrying() Allows infinite operation retries. LimitOperationsQueueTo (int limit) Sets the limit for number of outstanding operations (Default: 5000). FailOnNoServerResponse() Marks that no response from server should cause an error on the request. Cluster Settings When connecting to an Event Store HA cluster you must pass an instance of ClusterSettings as well as the usual ConnectionSettings . Primarily yu use this to tell the EventStoreConnection how to discover all the nodes in the cluster. A connection to a cluster will automatically handle reconnecting to a new node if the current connection fails. Using DNS Discovery DNS discovery uses a single DNS entry with several records listing all node IP addresses. The EventStoreConnection will then use a well known port to gossip with the nodes. Use ClusterSettings.Create().DiscoverClusterViaDns() followed by: <!-- TODO: Moved, to check. --> Builder Method Description SetClusterDns(string clusterDns) Sets the DNS name under which to list cluster nodes. SetClusterGossipPort(int clusterGossipPort) Sets the well-known port on which the cluster gossip is taking place. SetMaxDiscoverAttempts(int maxDiscoverAttempts) Sets the maximum number of attempts for discovery (Default: 10). SetGossipTimeout(TimeSpan timeout) Sets the period after which gossip times out if none is received (Default: 1 second). Note If you are using the commercial edition of Event Store HA with Manager nodes in place, the gossip port should be the port number of the external HTTP port on which the managers are running. If you are using the open source edition of Event Store HA the gossip port should be the External HTTP port that the nodes are running on. If you cannot use a well-known port for this across all nodes you can instead use gossip seed discovery and set the IPEndPoint of some seed nodes instead. Connecting Using Gossip Seeds The second supported method for node discovery uses a hardcoded set of IPEndPoint s as gossip seeds. Use ClusterSettings.Create().DiscoverClusterViaGossipSeeds() followed by: <!-- TODO: Moved, to check. --> Builder Method Description SetGossipSeedEndPoints(params IPEndPoint[] gossipSeeds) Sets gossip seed endpoints for the client. SetGossipSeedEndPoints(params GossipSeed[] gossipSeeds) Same as above, but allows a specific Host header to be sent with all HTTP requests. SetMaxDiscoverAttempts(int maxDiscoverAttempts) Sets the maximum number of attempts for discovery (Default: 10). SetGossipTimeout(TimeSpan timeout) Sets the period after which gossip times out if none is received (Default: 1 second). Connection Events EventStoreConnection exposes events that your application can use to be notifed of changes to the status of the connection. <!-- TODO: Not moved. --> Event Description EventHandler<ClientConnectionEventArgs> Connected Fired when an IEventStoreConnection connects to an Event Store server. EventHandler<ClientConnectionEventArgs> Disconnected Fired when an IEventStoreConnection disconnects from an Event Store server by some means other than by calling the Close method. EventHandler<ClientReconnectingEventArgs> Reconnecting Fired when an IEventStoreConnection is attempting to reconnect to an Event Store server following a disconnection. EventHandler<ClientClosedEventArgs> Closed Fired when an IEventStoreConnection is closed either using the Close method or when reconnection limits are reached without a successful connection being established. EventHandler<ClientErrorEventArgs> ErrorOccurred Fired when an error is thrown on an IEventStoreConnection . EventHandler<ClientAuthenticationFailedEventArgs> AuthenticationFailed Fired when a client fails to authenticate to an Event Store server."

    "title": "Competing Consumers | Event Store",
    "keywords": "Competing Consumers This document explains how to use .NET API for setting up and consuming competing consumer subscription groups. For an overview of competing consumers and how they relate to other subscription types, please see the overview document . Note The Administration UI includes a Competing Consumers section where a user can create, update, delete and view subscriptions and their statuses. Methods Creating a Persistent Subscription Before interacting with a subscription group, you need to create one. You will receive an error if you attempt to create a subscription group more than once. This requires admin permissions . Task<PersistentSubscriptionCreateResult> CreatePersistentSubscriptionAsync(string stream, string groupName, PersistentSubscriptionSettings settings, UserCredentials credentials); Updating a Persistent Subscription You can edit the settings of an existing subscription while it is running. This action drops the current subscribers and resets the subscription internally. This requires admin permissions . Task<PersistentSubscriptionUpdateResult> UpdatePersistentSubscriptionAsync(string stream, string groupName, PersistentSubscriptionSettings settings, UserCredentials credentials); Deleting a Persistent Subscription <!-- TODO: Explanation? --> Task<PersistentSubscriptionDeleteResult> DeletePersistentSubscriptionAsync(string stream, string groupName, UserCredentials userCredentials = null); Connecting to a Persistent Subscription <!-- TODO: Explanation? --> EventStorePersistentSubscription ConnectToPersistentSubscription( string groupName, string stream, Func<EventStorePersistentSubscription, ResolvedEvent, Task> eventAppeared, Action<EventStorePersistentSubscription, SubscriptionDropReason, Exception> subscriptionDropped = null, UserCredentials userCredentials = null, int bufferSize = 10, bool autoAck = true); Persistent Subscription Settings Both the Create and Update methods take a PersistentSubscriptionSettings object as a parameter. The methods use this object to provide the settings for the persistent subscription. A fluent builder is available for these options that you can locate using the Create() method. The following table shows the options you can set on a persistent subscription. Member Description ResolveLinkTos Tells the subscription to resolve link events. DoNotResolveLinkTos Tells the subscription to not resolve link events. PreferRoundRobin If possible preference a round robin between the connections with messages (if not possible uses next available). PreferDispatchToSingle If possible preference dispatching to a single connection (if not possible will use next available). StartFromBeginning Start the subscription from the first event in the stream. StartFrom(int position) Start the subscription from the position-th event in the stream. StartFromCurrent Start the subscription from the current position. WithMessageTimeoutOf(TimeSpan timeout) Sets the timeout for a client before retrying the message. CheckPointAfter(TimeSpan time) The amount of time the system should try to checkpoint after. MinimumCheckPointCountOf(int count) The minimum number of messages to write a checkpoint for. MaximumCheckPointCountOf(int count) The maximum number of messages not checkpointed before forcing a checkpoint. WithMaxRetriesOf(int count) Sets the number of times to retry a message should before considering it a bad message. WithLiveBufferSizeOf(int count) The size of the live buffer (in memory) before resorting to paging. WithReadBatchOf(int count) The size of the read batch when in paging mode. WithBufferSizeOf(int count) The number of messages to buffer when in paging mode. WithExtraStatistics Tells the backend to measure timings on the clients so statistics contain histograms of them. Creating a Subscription Group The first step of dealing with a subscription group is to create one. You will receive an error if you attempt to create a subscription group multiple times. You must have admin permissions to create a persistent subscription group. Note Normally you wouldn't create the subscription group in your general executable code. Instead, you create it as a step during an install or as an admin task when setting up Event Store. You should assume the subscription exists in your code. PersistentSubscriptionSettings settings = PersistentSubscriptionSettings.Create() .DoNotResolveLinkTos() .StartFromCurrent(); _result = _conn.CreatePersistentSubscriptionAsync(_stream, \"agroup\", settings, MyCredentials).Result; Parameter Description string stream The stream to the persistent subscription is on. string groupName The name of the subscription group to create. PersistentSubscriptionSettings settings The settings to use when creating this subscription. UserCredentials credentials The user credentials to use for this operation. Updating a Subscription Group You can edit the settings of an existing subscription group while it is running, you don't need to delete and recreate it to change settings. When you update the subscription group, it resets itself internally dropping the connections and having them reconnect. You must have admin permissions to update a persistent subscription group. PersistentSubscriptionSettings settings = PersistentSubscriptionSettings.Create() .DoNotResolveLinkTos() .StartFromCurrent(); _result = _conn.UpdatePersistentSubscriptionAsync(_stream, \"agroup\", settings, MyCredentials).Result; Note If you change settings such as startFromBeginning , this doesn't reset the group's checkpoint. If you want to change the current position in an update, you must delete and recreate the subscription group. Parameter Description string stream The stream to the persistent subscription is on. string groupName The name of the subscription group to update. PersistentSubscriptionSettings settings The settings to use when updating this subscription. UserCredentials credentials The user credentials to use for this operation. Deleting a Subscription Group Remove a subscription group with the delete operation. Like the creation of groups, you rarely do this in your runtime code and is undertaken by an administrator running a script. var result = _conn.DeletePersistentSubscriptionAsync(stream, \"groupname\", DefaultData.AdminCredentials).Result; Parameter Description string stream The stream to the persistent subscription is on. string groupName The name of the subscription group to update. UserCredentials credentials The user credentials to use for this operation. Connecting to a Subscription Group Once you have created a subscription group, clients can connect to that subscription group. A subscription in your application should only have the connection in your code, you should assume that the subscription was created via the client API, the restful API, or manually in the UI. The most important parameter to pass when connecting is the buffer size. This parameter represents how many outstanding messages the server should allow this client. If this number is too small, your subscription will spend much of its time idle as it waits for an acknowledgment to come back from the client. If it's too big, you waste resources and can start causing time out messages depending on the speed of your processing. var subscription = _conn.ConnectToPersistentSubscription(\"foo\", \"nonexisting2\", (sub, e) => Console.Write(\"appeared\"), (sub, reason, ex) =>{}); Parameter Description string stream The stream to the persistent subscription is on. string groupName The name of the subscription group to connect to. Action eventAppeared The action to call when an event arrives over the subscription. Action subscriptionDropped The action to call if the subscription is dropped. UserCredentials credentials The user credentials to use for this operation. int bufferSize The number of in-flight messages this client is allowed. bool autoAck Whether to automatically acknowledge messages after eventAppeared returns. Acknowledgements Clients must acknowledge (or not acknowledge) messages in the competing consumer model. If you enable auto-ack the subscription will automatically acknowledge messages once your handler completes them. If you throw an exception, it will shut down your subscription with a message and the uncaught exception. You can choose to not auto-ack messages. This can be useful when you have multi-threaded processing of messages in your subscriber and need to pass control to something else. There are methods on the subscription object that you can call Acknowledge, and NotAcknowledge both take a ResolvedEvent (the one you processed) both also have overloads for passing and IEnumerable<ResolvedEvent> . Consumer Strategies When creating a persistent subscription, the settings allow for different consumer strategies via the WithNamedConsumerStrategy method. Built-in strategies are defined in the enum SystemConsumerStrategies . Note HTTP clients bypass the consumer strategy which means it ignores any ordering or pinning. Strategy Name Description RoundRobin (default) Distributes events to all clients evenly. If the client bufferSize is reached the client is ignored until events are acknowledged/not acknowledged. DispatchToSingle Distributes events to a single client until the bufferSize is reached. After which the next client is selected in a round robin style, and the process is repeated. Pinned For use with an indexing projection such as the system $by_category projection. Event Store inspects event for its source stream id, hashing the id to one of 1024 buckets assigned to individual clients. When a client disconnects it's buckets are assigned to other clients. When a client connects, it is assigned some of the existing buckets. This naively attempts to maintain a balanced workload. The main aim of this strategy is to decrease the likelihood of concurrency and ordering issues while maintaining load balancing. This is not a guarantee , and you should handle the usual ordering and concurrency issues."
