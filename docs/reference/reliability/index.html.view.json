{"conceptual":"\n<p sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\" sourceendlinenumber=\"7\">You should look at reliability from a holistic perspective. Event Store treats data transactionally with full durability assurances, but this doesn&#39;t help you if the hardware on your machine does not support it.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\" sourceendlinenumber=\"9\">Many consumer grade disks (and SSDs especially) lie about durability to appear faster. This is fine until you have a power outage and lose information.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\" sourceendlinenumber=\"11\">These issues do not just affect Event Store. Other vendors and projects have created tests to check whether you may be losing data. We recommend running one of <a href=\"https://brad.livejournal.com/2116715.html\" data-raw-source=\"[these such tests](https://brad.livejournal.com/2116715.html)\" sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\" sourceendlinenumber=\"11\">these such tests</a> against your production environment.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\" sourceendlinenumber=\"13\">You can check the state of your drives on Linux by using the following command:</p>\n<pre sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\" sourceendlinenumber=\"17\"><code class=\"lang-bash\">sudo hdparm -I {drive}\n</code></pre><p sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\" sourceendlinenumber=\"19\">For example, check <em>/dev/sda</em> to see if caching is enabled on your drive. Be wary though, just because caching is disabled does not mean that all writes are fully durable. If you are running Linux you might want to consider adding the following to <em>/etc/hdparm.conf</em>:</p>\n<pre sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"21\" sourceendlinenumber=\"25\"><code class=\"lang-shell\">/dev/yourdrive {\n      write_cache = off\n}\n</code></pre><p sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"27\" sourceendlinenumber=\"27\">If you are running the clustered version of Event Store you may wish to allow these unlikely events to happen. The drives run faster with caching enabled and it&#39;s unlikely that you would lose three machines at the same time with corruption. If this were to happen you can truncate your data and re-replicate from the other nodes.</p>\n","type":"Conceptual","source":{"remote":{"path":"reference/reliability.md","branch":"feature/stats-REST","repo":"git@github.com:EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com.git"},"startLine":0.0,"endLine":0.0,"isExternal":false},"path":"reference/reliability.md","documentation":{"remote":{"path":"reference/reliability.md","branch":"feature/stats-REST","repo":"git@github.com:EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com.git"},"startLine":0.0,"endLine":0.0,"isExternal":false},"_docfxVersion":"2.43.3.0","_disableBreadcrumb":true,"_enableSearch":true,"_gitContribute":{"branch":"master"},"_appFaviconPath":"assets/favicon.ico","_appTitle":"Event Store","_appFooter":"&copy; 2019 Event Store Limited","_disableNavbar":false,"_disableToc":true,"_systemKeys":["conceptual","type","source","path","documentation","title","rawTitle","wordCount"],"title":"Reliability","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"reliability\" sourcefile=\"reference/reliability.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\" sourceendlinenumber=\"5\">Reliability</h1>","outputFileName":"index.html","wordCount":221.0,"_lang":"csharp","_tocPath":"toc.html","_navPath":"toc.html","_rel":"../../","_path":"reference/reliability/index.html","_key":"reference/reliability.md","_navRel":"../../toc.html","_tocRel":"../../toc.html","_navKey":"~/toc.yml","_tocKey":"~/toc.yml","__global":{"classesInSubtitle":"Classes","structsInSubtitle":"Structs","interfacesInSubtitle":"Interfaces","enumsInSubtitle":"Enums","delegatesInSubtitle":"Delegates","constructorsInSubtitle":"Constructors","fieldsInSubtitle":"Fields","propertiesInSubtitle":"Properties","methodsInSubtitle":"Methods","eventsInSubtitle":"Events","operatorsInSubtitle":"Operators","eiisInSubtitle":"Explicit Interface Implementations","functionsInSubtitle":"Functions","membersInSubtitle":"Members","improveThisDoc":"Improve this Doc","viewSource":"View Source","inheritance":"Inheritance","inheritedMembers":"Inherited Members","namespace":"Namespace","assembly":"Assembly","syntax":"Syntax","overrides":"Overrides","implements":"Implements","remarks":"Remarks","examples":"Examples","seealso":"See Also","declaration":"Declaration","parameters":"Parameters","typeParameters":"Type Parameters","type":"Type","name":"Name","description":"Description","returns":"Returns","fieldValue":"Field Value","propertyValue":"Property Value","eventType":"Event Type","exceptions":"Exceptions","condition":"Condition","extensionMethods":"Extension Methods","note":"<h5>Note</h5>","warning":"<h5>Warning</h5>","tip":"<h5>Tip</h5>","important":"<h5>Important</h5>","caution":"<h5>Caution</h5>","next":"<h5>Next Steps</h5>","_shared":{}},"docurl":"https://github.com/EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com/blob/master/reference/reliability.md/#L1"}
