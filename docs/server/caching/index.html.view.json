{"conceptual":"\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"7\" sourceendlinenumber=\"7\">As there are large differences between running Event Store in development and production, it&#39;s important to understand how caching works.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"9\" sourceendlinenumber=\"9\">Most of the URIs that Event Store emits are immutable (including the UI and Atom Feeds).</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\" sourceendlinenumber=\"11\">An Atom feed has a URI that represents an event, e.g., <code>/streams/foo/0</code>, representing &#39;event 0&#39;. The data for event 0 never changes. If this stream is open to public reads then the URI is set to be &#39;cachable&#39; for long periods of time.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\" sourceendlinenumber=\"13\">You can see a similar example in reading a feed. If a stream has 50 events in it, the feed page <code>20/forward/10</code> never changes, it will always be events 20-30. Internally Event Store controls serving the right URIs by using <code>rel</code> links with feeds (for example <code>prev</code>/<code>next</code>).</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\" sourceendlinenumber=\"15\">This caching behaviour is great for performance in a production environment and we recommended you use it, but in a developer environment it can become confusing.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"17\" sourceendlinenumber=\"17\">For example, what happens if you started a database, wrote <code>/streams/foo/0</code> and performed a <code>GET</code> request? The <code>GET</code> request is cachable and now in your cache. Since this is a development environment, you shutdown Event Store and delete the database. You then restart Event Store and write a different event to <code>/streams/foo/0</code>. You open your browser and inspect the <code>/streams/foo/0</code> stream, and you see the event written before you deleted the database.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"19\" sourceendlinenumber=\"19\">To avoid this during development it&#39;s best to run Event Store with the <code>--disable-http-caching</code> command line option. This disables all caching and solve the issue.</p>\n","type":"Conceptual","source":{"remote":{"path":"server/caching.md","branch":"feature/stats-REST","repo":"git@github.com:EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com.git"},"startLine":0.0,"endLine":0.0,"isExternal":false},"path":"server/caching.md","documentation":{"remote":{"path":"server/caching.md","branch":"feature/stats-REST","repo":"git@github.com:EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com.git"},"startLine":0.0,"endLine":0.0,"isExternal":false},"_docfxVersion":"2.43.3.0","_disableBreadcrumb":true,"_enableSearch":true,"_gitContribute":{"branch":"master"},"_appFaviconPath":"assets/favicon.ico","_appTitle":"Event Store","_appFooter":"&copy; 2019 Event Store Limited","_disableNavbar":false,"_disableToc":true,"_systemKeys":["conceptual","type","source","path","documentation","title","rawTitle","wordCount"],"title":"Caching","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"caching\" sourcefile=\"server/caching.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"5\" sourceendlinenumber=\"5\">Caching</h1>","outputFileName":"index.html","wordCount":250.0,"_lang":"csharp","_tocPath":"toc.html","_navPath":"toc.html","_rel":"../../","_path":"server/caching/index.html","_key":"server/caching.md","_navRel":"../../toc.html","_tocRel":"../../toc.html","_navKey":"~/toc.yml","_tocKey":"~/toc.yml","__global":{"classesInSubtitle":"Classes","structsInSubtitle":"Structs","interfacesInSubtitle":"Interfaces","enumsInSubtitle":"Enums","delegatesInSubtitle":"Delegates","constructorsInSubtitle":"Constructors","fieldsInSubtitle":"Fields","propertiesInSubtitle":"Properties","methodsInSubtitle":"Methods","eventsInSubtitle":"Events","operatorsInSubtitle":"Operators","eiisInSubtitle":"Explicit Interface Implementations","functionsInSubtitle":"Functions","membersInSubtitle":"Members","improveThisDoc":"Improve this Doc","viewSource":"View Source","inheritance":"Inheritance","inheritedMembers":"Inherited Members","namespace":"Namespace","assembly":"Assembly","syntax":"Syntax","overrides":"Overrides","implements":"Implements","remarks":"Remarks","examples":"Examples","seealso":"See Also","declaration":"Declaration","parameters":"Parameters","typeParameters":"Type Parameters","type":"Type","name":"Name","description":"Description","returns":"Returns","fieldValue":"Field Value","propertyValue":"Property Value","eventType":"Event Type","exceptions":"Exceptions","condition":"Condition","extensionMethods":"Extension Methods","note":"<h5>Note</h5>","warning":"<h5>Warning</h5>","tip":"<h5>Tip</h5>","important":"<h5>Important</h5>","caution":"<h5>Caution</h5>","next":"<h5>Next Steps</h5>","_shared":{}},"docurl":"https://github.com/EventStore/docs.geteventstore.com/blob/master/server/caching.md/#L1"}
