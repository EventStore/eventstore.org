Event Store allows you to change some values in the metadata, and you can write your own data into stream metadata that you can refer to in your code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reserved-names\" sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"11\" sourceendlinenumber=\"11\">Reserved Names</h3>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"13\" sourceendlinenumber=\"13\">All internal data used by Event Store is prefixed with a <code>$</code> character (for example <code>$maxCount</code> on a stream&#39;s metadata). Because of this you should not use names with a <code>$</code> prefix as event names, metadata keys, or stream names, except where detailed below.</p>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"15\" sourceendlinenumber=\"15\">The supported internal settings are:</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Name</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$maxAge</td>\n            <td>Sets a sliding window based on dates. When data reaches a certain age it disappears automatically from the stream and is considered eligible for scavenging. This value is set as an integer representing the number of seconds. This value must be &gt;=1.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$maxCount</td>\n            <td>Sets a sliding window based on the number of items in the stream. When data reaches a certain length it disappears automatically from the stream and is considered eligible for scavenging. This value is set as an integer representing the count of items. This value must be &gt;= 1.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$cacheControl</td>\n            <td>This controls the cache of the head of a stream. Most URIs in a stream are infinitely cacheable but the head by default will not cache. It may be preferable in some situations to set a small amount of caching on the head to allow intermediaries to handle polls (say 10 seconds). The argument is an integer representing the seconds to cache. This value must be &gt;= 1.</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<div class=\"NOTE\" sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"40\" sourceendlinenumber=\"40\"><h5>Note</h5><p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"41\" sourceendlinenumber=\"41\">If you set both <code>$maxAge</code> and <code>$maxCount</code> then events will become eligible for scavenging when either criteria is met. For example, if you set <code>$maxAge</code> to 10 and <code>$maxCount</code> to 50,000, events will be marked as eligible for scavenging after either 10 seconds, or 50,000 events, have passed. Deleted items will only be removed once the scavenge process runs.</p>\n</div>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"43\" sourceendlinenumber=\"43\">Security access control lists are also included in the <code>$acl</code> section of the stream metadata.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Name</th>\n            <th>Description</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$r</td>\n            <td>The list of users with read permissions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$w</td>\n            <td>The list of users with write permissions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$d</td>\n            <td>The list of users with delete permissions</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$mw</td>\n            <td>The list of users with write permissions to stream metadata</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>$mr</td>\n            <td>The list of users with read permissions to stream metadata</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"76\" sourceendlinenumber=\"76\">You can find more details on access control lists can <a href=\"~/server/users-and-access-control-lists.md\" data-raw-source=\"[here](users-and-access-control-lists.md)\" sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"76\" sourceendlinenumber=\"76\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"event-metadata\" sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"78\" sourceendlinenumber=\"78\">Event Metadata</h2>\n<p sourcefile=\"server/metadata-and-reserved-names.md\" sourcestartlinenumber=\"80\" sourceendlinenumber=\"80\">Every event in Event Store has metadata associated with it.
