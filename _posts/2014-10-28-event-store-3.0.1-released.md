Hot on the heels of version 3.0.0, which was released at our Birthday Party in London on September 17th, 2014, weâ€™re pleased to announce a service release of Event Store, version 3.0.1. This fixes a number of small bugs and updates the bundled version of the uder interface. The release notes are below.

###Event Store Server

- macOS binaries are now compatible with macOS 10.7 and above (#275)
- Gossip can be requested as `application/xml` or `text/xml` in addition to `application/json` (#275)
- It is no longer required to specify an event type when posting stream metadata, it is assumed to be `$settings`
- `X-Forwarded-Port` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are now supported to enable easier reverse proxying of the Event Store (#244)
- Link events are now served correctly when content is embedded in atom feeds (#228)

    - UI now displays linked events correctly (#226)
    - UI indicates events which are invalid due to windowing or deletion (#269)

###.NET Client API
