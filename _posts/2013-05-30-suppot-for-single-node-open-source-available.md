It seems there are many of you happy with the Event Store running on a single node (and therefore the open source version) in production but still would like to buy support for it.

We are therefore happy to oblige.

The offering has now been updated to allow a support contract to be purchased to run the Event Store on a single node. This is provided on the same basis as the support for the Event Store HA and at the same price. Same great developer led support, same peace of mind. Of course you can upgrade to the Event Store HA for failover, etc. at any time at no cost.

[Support](/support).

The usual lower price for support applies if you run the Event Store on one of our very awesome appliances.
