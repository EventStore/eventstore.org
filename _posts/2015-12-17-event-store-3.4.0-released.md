Event Store 3.4.0 is now released! The headline feature is the addition of the [HTTP API for “competing consumers”](/docs/http-api/competing-consumers/), but there have been numerous other improvements and bug fixes. We have also moved from self hosting our Event Store packages to hosting the packages on [packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/EventStore/EventStore-OSS).

There is also an accompanying update to the .NET Client API and the Embedded Client. These are now in the NuGet gallery.

The release notes for 3.4.0 are listed below, along with the release notes for 3.3.1 for completeness (they were posted on the GitHub release but never on this blog).
