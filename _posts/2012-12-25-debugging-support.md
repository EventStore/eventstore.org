Merry Christmas!

We are quite happy to announce that we have recently pushed debugging support for projections to the dev branch (will be on master shortly). When you have a failed projection there is a new button "debug" that you can click. The UI then will tell you how to debug using chrome as your browser.

This is actually quite easy to do based on the decision to make JavaScript the programming language for projections.
