The recent launch of the open-source version of Event Store—a rock-solid, super-fast persistence engine for supporting event sourcing—has been received with considerable interest by the developer community.

Greg Young gave a presentation to the launch event’s 77 attendees, covering the challenges the Event Store team has been able to overcome, the software&rsquo;s architecture and some of the patterns used. Commercial products including full support, a multi-node version, and rack-mountable appliances were also previewed.

**Special offer: all Event Store appliances ordered before 31st October 2012 will come with one year’s free support.**
