We are happy and excited to announce the release candidate 1 packages for Event Store 4.0.0. They are available for the following operating systems:

- Windows (via Chocolatey)
- Ubuntu 16.04 (via packagecloud)
- Ubuntu 14.04 (via packagecloud)

With Event Store 4.0.0 our headline feature will be projections. There are some other notable items that we have addressed and this is thanks to the community members who have raised these issues.

- Introduced a Package for Ubuntu 16.04.
- JavaScript Projections now support ECMASCRIPT 6.
- A series of projection issues has been fixed, which includes projections that seem to have just gotten stuck and refused to continue processing.
- Event Store on Linux has been upgraded to Mono 4.6.2.
- Event Store on Windows has been upgraded to .NET 4.6.
- Upgrade the stream version from int32 to int64. This ups the limit from events in a stream from int.MaxValue to long.MaxValue.

The following is the list of current release notes for RC 1
